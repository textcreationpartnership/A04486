            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

And ſo heereby I ſhall attaine (I hope) to be hereafter knowne vnto your Hon: which I account the greateſt part of my felicity.

               <p>And that the ſence and meaning of the Temples dedications might be the better vnderſtood, hee ordained that there ſhould be built but two gates on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in ſuch ſort that thoſe which went into the warres, could not enter into the Temple of Honour but by the gate and paſſage of <hi>Vertues</hi> Temple: within the which there ſtood carued in Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, a Goddeſſe, wondrous glorious, and rich in beauty; but arraied with the reſpectleſs and worthleſs weeds of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerty, enuironed on euery ſide with pricking thornes; ſignifying vnto the World, that none can attaine vnto true honor through the wanton delights,

For perſeuerance is the perfection and conſummation of all vertues: in ſuch ſort that no man can be that, which he is not euery day. None intitle them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:19962:14"/>
prudent, valiant, iuſt, or by the names of any other vertues, but ſuch as perſeuer with immoueable conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy.

               <p>We ſaye that ſhee impreſſeth in our vnderſtanding a perfect knowledge of

the true good. But now let vs define good to be that which is deſired of all, to bee beloued of itſelfe, foraſmuch as none would deſire it were it not good. But the nature of that which is good, requireth alſo that it bee honeſt, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant and acceptable.</p>
               <p>Hee then is good which hath theſe bleſſed gifts: humanity, affability, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, curteſie, ſimplicity, liberality, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty, and that declares the goodneſſe that is in him by his ſweete and louing conuerſation; dooing vnto all, ſuch things as are both good and profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.

               <p>Vnto goodnes we ioine verity, foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as it is the baſis and foundation of vertue, and whereon all things are grounded, which are, which ought to be knowne, which ought to bee belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, ſayd, and done, and without which nothing can ſubſiſt. It is a light which firſt of all is exceedingly cleere and ſplendent in it ſelfe, and which illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:19962:15"/>
the minds &amp; ſoules of thoſe that regard her with due contemplation.</p>
               <p>The means of ſeeking, and poſſeſſing this verity, conſiſteth in the inquiſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, vnderſtanding and beliefe: for (it being a light, a ſhining, and a glorious light) it is our fault and not hers if ſhee be hidden, if ſhee be ſecret. Wherefore we ought to make a ſerious ſearch, of her, and vnderſtand her well, before we can beleeue her, before wee can poſſeſſe her. But it may bee, that the vnderſtanding and minde of man is ſo inuelloped, ſo muffled with the thicke cloaking and choaking clouds of vice, that it cannot be able to giue intertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment vnto the knowledge of veritie, for as much as it ſtoppes vp the paſſage and entrance of the Soule, againſt both the knowledge and the loue thereof, detaining the ſpirite cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue, and forcing it downe vnder the yoake of ſeruitude.

She diſcouereth that which is ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret and hidden, diſcerning all things, by their true and proper differences: ſhee teacheth to know truely and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely the nature and quality of euery one, &amp; how to iudge infallibly. Hence it is that ſuch as worke miſchiefe, are vnwilling, nay they feare to haue their wicked actions made manifeſt by ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. And contrarily a good man is ſo conſtant, ſo reſolutely aſſured in his confeſſion, that none can conſtraine him to deny or diſauow what hee hath done, what hee hath ſaid; but rather ſhewes himſelfe, nay certainely is, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to ſeale it with his bloud.</p>
               <p>Verity needs not any decking orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or any helpe of outward things to magnifie her worth. She taketh de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to be naked, and effecteth many things of great moment by her pure ſimplicity: ſhe will not, nay ſhe cannot bee peruerted by the flattering elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:19962:16"/>
of falſe witneſſe and calumni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous teſtimonies: for by her nakednes (which is bright &amp; glorious) ſhee quels them all, ſhee vtterly confounds them.</p>
               <p>It may be that ſhee may ſometimes be oppugned, but neuer vanquiſhed. For to be vanquiſhed, is to be diuerted from a former determinate conſultati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to bee changed from an abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-intended purpoſe, or beeing aſſaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to become ſubiect to the power of an enemie. Euen in this ſort are we van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed by the trecherous affections of a couetous and a greedy minde, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king vs to forſake and abandon the paths of vertue. He is truely ouercome or vanquiſhed, that hath loſt his ſute or cauſe in iudgement: and ſo is hee, who being ouercome in warre eyther by ſtrength or ſtratageme, becomes a ſeruant, (nay, ſeruile ſlaue) vnto his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie.</p>
               <p>But if any of theſe or the like incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniences chance to be founde in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, it muſt then needes bee confeſſed, that indeed ſhe may be foiled; nay, quite
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:19962:17"/>
ouercome, by violence, by iniuſtice; but neuer ceaſe to be the ſelfe ſame in ſubſtance, no more then the pureſt, the perfecteſt gold can ceaſe to challenge the appellation of gold. It is moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that it may bee ſometimes ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurde, and diſguiſed, by calumnious detraction, by ſlanderous reproch, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the face-changing viſard of treche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous falſhood: but neuer can bee chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged into a truthleſs fable; foraſmuch as that which is, can neuer bee tranſlated into that which is not. If ſhe be proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the perſecuting hands of blou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Tyrants, it is not impoſſible for her to ſuffer iniurious violence, in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of thoſe that follow her, but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible in her ſelfe: for ſhe cannot bee inforced to ſubmit her ſelfe vnto the pitty and compaſſion of her foe falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, but continues alwaies victorious alwaies triumphant. For verity ſubſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth by itſelfe, and by her owne force and power, preſerues her eſſence to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity.</p>
               <p>In like manner may we ſay that ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:19962:17"/>
is a habit in goodneſſe which reſts not contentfully ſatisfied, by imprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting onely in our minds the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and bare vnderſtanding thereof, but giues direction alſo vnto our will; which wee define to bee that abſolute and free facultie which onely is in our power, wherby we deſire the true good, and eſchew the euill by the helpfull aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of reaſons conduct. It is moſt certainly true, that the nature and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of our will, cannot tolerate it, to imbrace any other thing within the louely folding armes of earneſt deſire, but that onely which is <hi>verè bonum</hi> truly good; without eyther coueting or willing that which is any way euill.</p>
               <p>But heerein lyes the curſed croſſe of all, that vice and falſhood become eft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoon diſguiſed, counterfeited; and atti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring themſelues with vertues abilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are often repreſented vnto the worldly man vnder the perſons of goodnes and verity.</p>
               <p>And againe, the affections, breaking their ranks of order, and falling into
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:19962:18"/>
monſtrous confuſion (which is to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey them) doe wholely bend the cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of their deſires, towards that which indeede is nothing elſe but a vain ſhew, a falſe ſhadow of pretended good.</p>
               <p>Wherfore it is moſt neceſſarily expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, that ſhe be inlightned by reaſons glittering rayes, to bee inſtructed and directed by the guidance of vertue, in the election of that which is good, and in the diſcerning of that which is pure and perfect from that which is falſe and counterfaite: briefly, ſo to rule and gouerne the affections, that they obey her as dutifull ſeruants, following and ſeruing her to the atchieuement of the true good.</p>
               <p>For indeede humane affections are ſettled in the minds of men, to cauſe vs to reioyce, when we haue beene the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of any good, affecting the ſoul as it were with a ioyfull trumpet, and to condemne vs when we haue done euill as a ſharp reuenger of the ſame: ſo that wee beeing conuinced in our ſelues of doing euill, our conſciences being tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched,

               <p>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:19962:19"/>They are therefore the raines of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons moderation, which bridle our wil from eyther declining or perſeuering in that which is eyther euill or errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and by her diuine inſtructions conformeth vs vnto that commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble habit, to cauſe vs to march forward conſtantly in al that which is inſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly conioyned with iuſt endeauours, captiuating the affections of our ſouls, vnder the preſcript inſtitutions of her lawes. But let it bee, that that the mind of man is ſtored with many ſundry af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, as loue, hate, boldnes, feare, ſadnes, ioy, hope, deſpaire, anger, enuy, a wicked, and a good will: yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding vertue is neither an affection nor yet any other of the faculties of the ſoul, but an vſuall habit &amp; familiar cuſtome of doing good, through the election and deſire therof, and a mean betweene the extreames of affections and paſſions, in ſuch ſort that a wicked or a good man is diſtinctly diſcerned by either vitious or vertuous actions, and is not (as ſome would haue it) deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cried
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:19962:19"/>
by affections. For to man, for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing eyther loued, or hated, feared or not feared, cannot bee attributed this appellation of euill or good; but hee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, which feareth or feareth not, that which he ought or ought not to feare: foraſmuch as hee that effecteth any thing, only by the motion of his will, without aduiſed and deliberate conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation thereof, cannot in any ſort duely challenge vnto himſelfe the title of vertuous: but can rightly do the ſame, if hee haue executed it with willing deſire, hauing before ſufficiently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted and knowne it to be good.</p>
               <p>In ſuch ſort that no man for eyther louing or fearing abſolutely, can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue to bee reputed good or bad: nor merit eyther praiſe or diſpraiſe, but he alone which loueth or feareth that which is conuenient or not conuenie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. Becauſe to loue, to hate, to dare, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, to fear, to be angry, to be appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, to be melancholy, to reioyce, are all affections, which are indifferent to our ſoule, in ſuch ſort, as for the things
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:19962:20"/>
which happely chance vnto vs, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out electing, or conſidering them, wee cannot bee ſaid to merit grace or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, praiſe or diſpraiſe. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vertue is ſaid to be a habit of doing well through a willing deſire and free election, and a meane betweene the extreames of affections and paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: which ought to buſie it ſelf in ſuch ſort that ſhee doe not onely grace the ſubiect wherein ſhee is, with the ſtile of good, but the deedes alſo which proceed from thence; as the graffe which is ingraffed makes not only the tree good whereon it growes, but the fruites alſo which proceed from it.</p>
               <p>So that we may wel then conclude, that vertue is a very powerfull diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the reaſonable part of the ſoule, which diſpoſeth and limiteth the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable part with agreeable conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency, and decent proportion, preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribing vnto the affections, a well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitting end, whereby the ſoule alwaies perſiſteth in due correſpondency, ſtill plotting, ſtill effecting that, which
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:19962:20"/>
ought to bee done by the rules of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. But this powerfull diſpoſition (which wee may very well call diuine reaſon, whoſe princely place of reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is the ſoule) is properly called a morall vertue, poſſeſſing the meane of the affections, depending betweene much and little, not abſolutely, but in reſpect. For that which is abſolute, is alwaies the ſelfe ſame thing in al cauſes and at all times: but that which is conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in reſpect of another, falleth out oftentimes to be diuers, according to the variety of thoſe things vnto which it is referred. As for example; If the number tenne bee too many, and the number two too few, the number ſixe ſhould be a meane in reſpect of the two extreames. But relating it with other numbers, it will then ſtraight way hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to bee diuers, according to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers reſpects of the relation: as if ten miles of exerciſe, for remedying a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe be too much, and 2. miles too litle, ſixe miles therefore, will not bee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunce iuſtly a meane: and the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:19962:21"/>
reaſon of this diſproportion ariſeth from the manifold diuerſities of mans complexions: for it may be, that vnto one, ſixe miles wil be too little, and to another of the ſame diſeaſe too much. That is called <hi>medium geometricum,</hi> a Geometricall meane, whereunto no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be added, and from whence nothing can bee ſubtracted. And in ſuch ſort, it muſt bee vnderſtood that vertue is the true and perfect meane of the affections of the ſoul, (as the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber ſixe is of twelue) not abſolutely but in reſpect: for, hauing a regardfull con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, aſwell vnto the diuerſities of the eſtates and conditions of men, as alſo vnto the times and diuers occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of working, it is very neceſſary that this meane (wherein vertue conſiſteth) be vnderſtood reſpectiuely. In ſuch ſort that being in the meane betweene too much, and too little (as ſixe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene two and ten) as when a man feares and loues extreamely, as well in exceſſe as in defect, vertue whoſe reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is is the meane betweene both, is

               <p>Her greateſt vndertakings are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out feare: ſhe ſtickes not (after ſound counſell and ſerious aduice) to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe actions full of threatning dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and to perſeuere therein, with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moueable conſtancye. For, Conſtancy is the dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t page of manly Fortitude, and is neuer from his elbowe, though ſhee tread the crimſon paths of warre, and march euen vp at knees in a fielde of bloud. Moreouer, none of the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues can be conſummated, and truely accompliſhed without conſtancy. Hee that hath one vertue hath not alwaies the other: but hee that hath this, hath all others whatſoeuer; foraſmuch as ſhee is neuer found, but euen in the full perfection, both of the will and power
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:19962:28"/>
And therefore ſhe magnifieth her poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſour, making him to diſdeigne ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the pinch of ſorrow, or the feare of death: making him to account no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, eyther intolerable or trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, which is poſſible to befall a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall wight; nor any thing bad, which is eyther neceſſary, or ineuitable. Briefly, it is the knowledge of that which ought to bee ſuſtained, when as we fight for the maintena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of Iuſtice.</p>
               <p>This vertue is alſo diuided into foure principal branches, to wit: mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence, Confidence, Patience and Perſeuerance. Magnificence, is ſhewed in the atchieuing of great and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent things.</p>
               <p>Confidence appeares, when as a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous mind is indued with an aſſured hope of the happy ſucceſſe of his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings.</p>
               <p>Patience appares, in the volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and continuall ſufferance, which is ſuſtained for the meere loue of hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty and vertue.</p>
               <p>Perſeuerance, is ſeene in the perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:19962:28"/>
Conſtancy, and firme continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of deſſignes and reſolutions, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſed vpon good conſiderations by the perſwaſions of reaſon.</p>
               <p>The fourth and more eminent ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue is Iuſtice: which we define, to bee a conſtant and perpetuall willingnes, of doing right and reaſon vnto all, with an equall and proportionate diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion according to euery ones merite and deſert.</p>
               <p>Wherefore this vertue comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth within itſelfe, all others whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer; foraſmuch as man ſhould not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to diſcerne iuſt from vniuſt, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to embrace the one and eſchew the other, were hee not alſo indued with prudence: for as much as this is a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar property, ſolely depending on that vertue. In like manner alſo hee would hardly be able to put in practiſe the preceps of Iuſtice, that is not indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with temperance; wherewith hee might moderate all the paſſions, and particular affections of his owne minde.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:19962:29"/>Furthermore, hee cannot fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme one of the chiefeſt and diuineſt parts of Iuſtice (which is, to giue helpe and ſuccour, vnto the afflicted &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted ſoule, when there is need ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, be it in what danger ſoeuer) if, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of manly courage and true forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, he doe not contemne death, ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe, griefe, and whatſoeuer elſe the world containes, and ſo to be (as neare as fleſh and blood will permit) a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect imitatour of Diuinity.</p>
               <p>In ſuch ſort that hee alone is to bee ſtiled Iuſt, which rendreth good vnto as many as he can, without offering in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurie vnto any one, hauing no ſtriuing contentions within his owne breaſt, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining a louing ſeruant to his God, and a gentle friend vnto his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</p>
               <p>This vertue is twofold: <hi>Diſtributa &amp; Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mutatiue.</hi> The Diſtributiue, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth in giuing vnto euery one accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his merit, whether it bee ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, dignity, or puniſhment. The Commutatiue, conſiſteth in obſeruing
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:19962:29"/>
our faith, and credit in our promiſes &amp; couenants; and neuer doing vnto any, that which wee would not haue others doe vnto vs.</p>
               <p>From this generall fountaine, iſſue forth theſe foure riuers (which by an Allegory haue bene termed the riuers of the terreſtriall Paradiſe, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies water the little worlde) Prudence, Temperance, Fortitude, and Iuſtice: which are as neceſſary to be conioynd, and vnited in him, which deſireth to be perfectly vertuous, as the ſeparation of them would bee preiudiciall to his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate. For no man can bee temperate, if hee bee not formerly prudent: foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as euery vertuous action pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth from knowledge, and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. In like manner man can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer bee truely valiant and magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, if formerly he be not temperate; foraſmuch as ſuch a one, that is indued with a generous and an vndaunted ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, without moderation would in a ſhort ſeaſon become deſperate: and he that ſhould be temperate and not cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rageous,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:19962:30"/>
would in a ſhort time become a coward. In like manner, Iuſtice with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Prudence, and Temperance, would ſhortly bee tranſformed into bloudy Tyranny. In ſuch ſort the vertues, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vnited and knit together, are all abſolutely perfect: but, beeing diſioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned once, and ſeparated, they become feeble, &amp; are ouerborn by the ſtrength of vice. Wherefore theſe fower vertues being ordained as a ſure baſis, and firm foundation vnto euery one, that ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly deſireth to bee perfectly vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, they ought to ſerue him as an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect and mirrour of his contemplatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, wherein he ſhall not onely behold the vgly deformities and defects of nature; but alſo remedies againſt the ſame: to attaine vnto the which, three thinges are to be obſerued by him, which ſhall be declared in the Chapter following.</p>

               <p>Therefore it may bee ſaid, that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon produceth the ſame effect in the ſoule of a Prudent man, that health doth vnto a ſickly body. For, freeing it
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:19962:38"/>
from all torturing paſſions, it doth giue a ioyfull pleaſance and a ſweete content in all ſorts of conditions what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer, making her both apt and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye to all laudable and vertuous ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.</p>
               <p>The thirde that remaineth to be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, is Vſe: wherby nature is faſhio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and confirmed in the habit of true good. Wee therefore ſay that it conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth in the continuall exerciſe, aſwell of the minde as of the body, in the ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, trauell, and diſquiſition of honeſt things; for as much as that which is done once and againe, yea often reite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, nay continued with a pawſeleſſe perſeuerance, ſhall bee abſolutely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed at the end.</p>
               <p>For euen as little droppes of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, by the continuance of time, doe hollow and pierce the hardeſt flint: Euen ſo good manners, and vertuous conditions, are certaine effectuall qualities which make a wondrous greate impreſsion in the ſoule, by a long vſe. And how
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:19962:39"/>
rude, and vntractable a nature ſoeuer it be: yet at length, by labour and care, diligence and long cuſtome, it is reclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, beeing made both attentiue and obtemperate to reaſons precepts.</p>
               <p>There are 3. points very remarque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, whoſe obſeruation is meruailous neceſſary, and of great importance. The firſt is to contemne ſlouthfulneſs, and eſchew all diſſolute conuerſation. The ſecond is to imploy the time in ſuch things as are both honeſt and profitable, and to forward all our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings with due perſeuerance. The third is to reape a profitable benefit aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well from the euil of our ſelues as from the calamities of another.</p>
               <p>Concerning ſloathfulnes, it is one of Natures monſters. Nature made no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing idle in the world: but all things (whatſoeuer) haue continuall motion. To proue the which, our ſoules may ſerue as a ſufficient argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, which are continually in perpetuall action.</p>
               <p>And euen as the water that makes a ſtanding poole is ſoone putrefied and
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:19962:39"/>
corrupted: euen ſo the natures and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions of thoſe that lead their retch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe liues in lazye ſlothfulneſs, are quickly diſtempered with a ſottiſh dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes; for as much as lazines is not only exceeding preiudiciall to the perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſoule, but alſo a ſterne ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie to the bodies health: for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsiue reſt which is gaind by idlenes, indommageth more (by many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees) the ſound eſtate of a healthfull perſon, then a wondrous painefull, and laborious exerciſe. For great and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall labours doe extinguiſh the heat of luxurye, and fire of concupiſcence: whereas idle ſluggiſhnes addeth fewel, and oyle, vnto the flames of them. For as much as hee that doeth nothing, learneth eyther to doe, or to thinke e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, or perchance both: which our poore ſoules are often guilty of, being not buſied with ſome contemplation, wandring and ſtraying vp and downe like maſterleſſe and vnimployed run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagates, eaſily to bee diuerted from truth and honeſty, and as eaſily indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:19962:40"/>
to follow vanitye: which cauſeth dayly ſo many contentions, and accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed quarrels, from whence ſo many murthers vſually inſue.</p>
               <p>In Conſideration whereof a man ought not onely to auoide ſuch ſlug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſh lazynes, but alſo to eſchew the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar ſociety &amp; inward acquaintance of all thoſe, whoſe conuerſation is ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dangerous or vnprofitable; foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as euill examples, and wicked deſignes, are great corrupters of ciuill demeanors, and onely deprauers of an honeſt nature: which being peruerted from what is good, there is no miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe in the world too great for their attempts, their vndertakings. For ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues exerciſes being once abandoned, idlenes tranſporteth man vnto a play, wherin he durſt raile, and reuile his lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing neighbours, yea banne and blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme the name of God, and at length moſt barbarouſly conſume his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and deſpiſe himſelfe; and then (theſe things ſtanding thus) runnes into deſperate and accurſed
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:19962:40" rendition="simple:additions"/>
courſes, and makes baſe conycatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the only certainety of his future poſſibilities. Being nowe become a couſening Gull, hee eſteemeth it no more ſinfull to rob, than to doe that: from robbing hee becomes a mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer; and ſo by degrees hee moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth ſtill, and neuer ceaſeth till ſuch time as hee haue attained vnto the higheſt top of all impiety. For one vice hauing once vndermined the ſoule of man, and made an entrance into it, all other vices finde the way more eaſie.</p>
               <p>And as for time, (which their ſleepy drowſines will not permit them to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue) it is ſo choyce, ſo pretious a thing; that it is ſaid to be, <hi>ſolum ſine pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri,</hi> only that in the world which wants a parallel, hath no compariſon.

<pb n="64" facs="tcp:19962:41"/>
deſerueth rather to bee called a little little nothing, then the reall ſubſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence of any thing. In ſuch ſort that theſe little moment: any minutes being once loſt, a ſerious debating with our ſelues at laſt, ſhal find them to be a great diminution of our dayes; whoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption beeing hopeleſſe, they doe leaue in our ſoules a wofull remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance that they once paſt by: and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity poſting by vs, &amp; not finding vs within, or (which is as bad) not ready to entertaine her, hath left recorded in the tables of our memories (to our greateſt greefe of all) that when ſhee proffered her ſelfe accompanied with good occaſion in gentle curteſie, wee moſt vnkindly, or careleſly eyther deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſed or neglected her: by which neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect we purchaſed to our ſelues a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drous preiudice: for as much as in the obſeruance of her, wholy depends the full accompliſhment of our affaires. For opportunity being a part of time which preſenteth her ſelfe vnto vs, her acquaintance, nay her familiarity

ought to bee eſteemed as of great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, and not ſo careleſly to let her paſſe, and in paſſing, loſe her; for in ſuffering her to turne her backe, ſhee is paſt and wee haue loſt occaſion, which beeing once eſcaped can neuer be recouered: from whence proceeds euen as much blame as dommage.</p>
               <p>If the Pilot prize windes, times, and tides conuenient for his voyage at a high rate, arming himſelfe with manly courage, to withſtand the angry ſeas tempeſtuous outrages, how much more carefull ought wee to bee, to make good and profitable imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof, towards the attaining of the knowledge and vnderſtanding of the celeſtiall Nauigation; who are not to paſſe through the ſtormes and tempeſts of the ſea, but the ſurging billowes of paſſions, and death-mena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing outrages of our leud affections, which are farre worſe then a thouſand perillous rockes and dangerous ſhelfs, which euery minute, and moment of our liues, doe threaten the ſhipwracke

               <p>For the experience which procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth from the remembrance of others miſeries, is a very powerfull doctrine to aduiſe vs. For it is a compendious courſe and an eaſy methode vnto eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one, to diſcerne by the ſucceſſe of others, how he ought to demeane him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in the proſecution of buſineſſe of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And euen as a good parcell of ground produceth many bad weeds which deſtroy and quite choak vp the good and profitable fruites, if it be not carefully preſerued and husbanded: E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen ſo a well diſpoſed nature, by bad in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, will ſoone bee corrupted and become pernitious: as on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, hauing had wholeſome educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and vertuous nourture, it will produce moſt excellent fruits; which

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE ſecond effect of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, is to teach him to know vice and the inconuenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces proceeding thence: for not to vnderſtand any thing thereof, hauing beene made ſenſeleſſe with long continuance &amp; alwaies pampered
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:19962:58"/>
with the carnall pleaſures of voluptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes, is filthy beaſtlineſs, and an ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance (much to be lamented) of ſuch things as ought eſpecially to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of him, that would leade a vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and an honeſt life; that by the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titheſis or compariſon of Vertue with her moſt repugnant oppoſite, hee might eſteem her farre more amiable, and hate vice with a greater deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
<q>
                     <l>Which is a rothing: an infirmity:</l>
                     <l>A restleſſe trauell: a priuation:</l>
                     <l>A griefe that doth torment the memory:</l>
                     <l>A liuing death: an imperfection.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>For as Vertue is the life of the ſoule which cauſeth her felicity; euen ſo is Vice the death thereof: Foraſmuch as it ſmothereth, nay quite extinguiſheth the ſhining light of diuine reaſon.</p>
               <p>The one hath nothing elſe but good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and verity for her foundation: and contrarily the other, hath nothing for her ſupportance but miſchiefe and ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:19962:58"/>
which may (very deſeruedly) bee called the cheriſhing foſterers of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed vice, foraſmuch as from this marriage as from their ſource, proceed all ſorts of errours, and impiety. For as to haue the inioyance of goodnes &amp; verity, is to bee indued with a qualitie, that is alwaies in action, alwaies brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging foorth effects: euen ſo miſchiefe and lying, are certain qualities, alwaies in action, alwaies labouring without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion, for the production of Vice.</p>
               <p>But if euill be a defect of good, and lying falſhhood a priuation of verity, what then is vice? being an extreame paſſion wholely deſtitute of the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of reaſon, and conſequently, a continuall trauaile without repoſe, and a perpetually tormenting angariation of the minde. For preſently aſſoone as vertues motion ceaſeth, vice is at hand to take poſſeſſion.</p>

               <p>
                  <pb n="98" facs="tcp:19962:59"/>Her firſt and chiefeſt care is to charm our credulous ſenſes with her inchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting pleaſures; and hauing well rooted her wicked ſelfe within our harts, doth ſtraightway captiuate our reſiſtleſs wil, making her a ſeruile and a baſe bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaue vnto the affections and paſſions of the ſoule: which hauing depriued her ſelfe of Reaſons Pilotſhippe (by falling at variance with herſelfe) is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced to leaue her (now wretched and miſerable) ſelfe, to bee tranſported vp and downe, according to the extraua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant deſires of ſenſualitie.</p>

               <p>In like manner, the ſoule that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenteth vnto vice, makes her ſelfe an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall ſharer of all the croſſes and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions that proceed from it.

thouſand fooliſh imaginations, which continually beget ſo many errours, ſo many crimes, ſo many diſobediences &amp; diſloyalties, againſt her Soueraigne, forming &amp; framing al (both) thoughts and actions directly againſt his will: In ſuch manner that (being depriued of the gift of grace) ſhee runneth wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully into the obſcure dungeons of miſchiefe and errour, fully oppoſit and contrary to her owne naturall quality and condition, which takes delight in nothing more then light and verity.</p>
               <p>Beeing then deſtitute of true vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, ſhee chuſeth rather the euill then the good, and falſhood then veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Miſerable and wretched conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of man! which ſuffereth himſelfe to bee thus tranſported vnto vice, which hee ought ſo much the more to hate, by how much the more inconueniences, and greater infelicityes it bringeth to his ſoule.</p>
               <p>This tree of death hath 3. ſprouting branches, euery one whereof ſpreads it ſelfe into many great boughs, the fruits
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:19962:60"/>
wherwith they are abundantly loaden, are all ſorts of vices and impiety.</p>
               <p>The firſt of them is Auarice, the root of all euils, foraſmuch as the nature &amp; quality hereof is an earneſt deſire and an endleſſe coueting of all the riches and treaſures of the Worlde: which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing congeſted in an huge heape, haue a powerfull vertue to withdraw the eye of the ſoule, from the ſoule, to it, or at leaſt ſo to blind the ſame, that ſhee ſhall neuer bee able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme her duety, her honour vnto God, nor the well intended actions of her owne Conſcience.</p>
               <p>Of Auarice there are two kinds: the one is pinching, nigardly, ſordide, ſot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh, and brutiſh: of which ſort is that, which poſſeſſeth the hearts and minds of thoſe baſe and monſtrous miſers, who for feare of loſing the ſiluer and gold, (which oftentimes they enioy, not through their owne labours and induſtry, but deſcended vnto them cloſely enwrapped in a cheſt of iron from their couetous fathers &amp; grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers)
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:19962:60"/>
doe with a ſollicitous and pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiue care impriſon nay timorouſly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomb it, within the ſecret bowels of the earth for feare of waſting or dimini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing it. Yet vnto ſuch as theſe are, their greedy and inſatiable auarice neuer begets a iot of profit, neyther to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues nor their ſucceſſours, foraſmuch as the deſire of increaſing ingendreth in their corrupted and dunghil-minds ſo ſtrange a humour of ſparing, that they cannot finde in their conſciences, more then reſiſtleſſe and peremptory neceſſity conſtraineth, to prouide bread for their euen famiſhed bellies, or conuenient apparel to hide their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes; but dayly feede themſelues on browne bread and potage, and make their beſt liquor a cup of cold water. All their labours and induſtries, all their pleaſures, all their content, and chiefeſt felicities, conſiſt in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation, admiration, &amp; idolatrous worſhip of this their ſweete Saint, their good, their God, which they euerie moment of time, warme, cheriſh, ſit a
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:19962:61"/>
brood on, both with the eye of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye and of the ſoule, not vnlike vnto the Tortoyſe who burieth her egges in a heape of ſand. They are ſuch cruel tyrants &amp; mercileſs enemies to poore nature, that they will not lend vnto themſelues, eight or tenne angels to worke their owne redemption from a deteſted priſon, neither would they by any meanes whatſoeuer, be induced to beſtow any thing in procuring a medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine for their greateſt malady. And in this ridiculous and ſtrange manner paſſe they ouer their wretched life in a voluntary pouerty, that after their death they may be ſtiled rich.</p>
               <p>The other is more violent and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenous then the former, which (in ſome ſort) may be ſaid to be contented with what it hath; whereas this, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies tortured with a deſire of hauing more: which ſtill increaſeth with his ill-gained gold, not reſpecting in the ſcraping in of it (ſo it be haue-able) ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> what men, or by what meane.</p>
               <p>In ſuch ſort, that whoſoeuer are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertaken
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:19962:61"/>
by this paſſion, may be truly ſaid to haue but a poore conſcience. For thus hee debateth with himſelfe: What? ſhall the impiety of the action deterre my ſoule from the proſecution of mine owne commodity? No: On, and faint not: The ſinne is but on af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighting bugbeare and a toye in reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of the gaines that are gotten; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a ſubtill (but diuelliſh) ſeparation, betweene honeſt and profitable, in ſuch a faſhion that neither ſhame nor feare can repreſſe or repell his coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous cruelty.</p>
               <p>Of this kind there are alſo two ſorts. The one is ambitious: as when one man deſireth to ſurpaſſe all others in lands and ſubſtances, by what at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts or paſſages ſoeuer. F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>in the purſuit of ſuch a prize, nothing ſhall bee refuſed that may be helpfull.</p>
               <p>This kinde of couetouſneſſe is full of daunger, and eſpecially if it bee in ſuch as haue authority, and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. For hauing force and conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encie within the liſts or compaſſe of
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:19962:62"/>
their owne armes, they haue (by way of conſequence) a very commodious and facile meanes of vſing violence, and extortion, towards the increaſe of their golden dunghils; not with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and determination of ſparing par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimony, as the former, but of lauiſh &amp; profuſe luxury, &amp; of hauing wherewith to furniſh their magnificence, &amp; bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe liberality ſo that (reference being made vnto this) it is not ſo much to be diſcommended, as that which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth after. For this hath (I know not how) a generous diſpoſition; and the other following, a violent and inſatia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble paſſion, which killeth downright as many as are vnder the iuriſdiction and power of its commaund, with ſorrow, care, anguiſh, and trauell. For ſhee will driue them through fields and woods, through thicke and thinne, by ſea and by lande, in winter and ſommer, night and day, through hot and cold, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the allowance of one poore mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes reſt. And after this manner will ſhe inforce them to gather riches and
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:19962:62"/>
treaſures, with paines and perill, berea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing them preſently of the right vſe of them: for couetouſneſſe increaſing, pleaſure is diminiſhed, nay quite taken away. O truely miſerable and vnhappy condition! Sithence man is neuer ſo bleſſed, hauing the full fruition of all his deſires, as he ſhould bee, if he would not deſire at all. For if the deſire of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, bee not limmited with reaſons bounding pillars, which haue <hi>Ne plus vltra</hi> engrauen in them, it is farre more full of danger then pinching pouertye, becauſe great deſiring bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth great want, and is no more allay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with with purchaſed treaſures, then flames are quenched with wood and oyle.</p>
               <p>For, the deſire of hauing, doth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies increaſe by the hauing of things deſired. The medicinable remedy which hee ſearcheth after in ſiluer and gold, for the qualification of his mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, doth nothing elſe but increaſe his miſerye.</p>
               <p>Cheſts and coffers, purſes and pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:19962:63"/>
bagges and budgets may in time bee filled; but the inſatiable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of a couetous man can neuer: for the bottome of the ſea is not ſo deepe as it.</p>
               <p>The couetous man neuer regardeth what content hee might deriue from the ſubſtance which he poſſeſſeth; but how wel he ſhould be, had he but ſome great matter which hee hath not: and therefore preſſeth he all his indeuours by day, &amp; care by night, for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſing of that, which had, tormenteth him.</p>
               <p>This alſo is the moſt miſerable, moſt deteſtable paſsion, that euer lodged in the heart of man. Other deſires are capable of ſariety, and ſo by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, of quiet comfort. But this is as farre from eyther, as the earth from Heauen.</p>
               <p>The luxurious belly-god abſteineth ſometimes, from a palate-pleaſing morſell, becauſe he hath already ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorged his ſtomack: and the ſwiniſh drunkard loathes (now and then) your
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:19962:63"/>
ſparking Claret, ſtomack-ſetting Sack, or ſome neater wine, becauſe his hogſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head belly, is ouertunned already: but the couetous Vulpone is neuer ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: ſo infinitely great are his deſires, that they are without ſatiety, without end. His heart is like the Ocean, whoſe banks (though all the Riuers in the world flowe into the ſame) are neuer the fuller. And briefly this is <hi>Tantalus,</hi> who ſtandeth full in the midſt twixt water and apples, yet ſtarueth with hunger and thirſt.</p>
               <p>In ſuch ſort, that whoſoeuer is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with this paſsion, becomes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatiable, inhumane, ſubtill, enuious, curious, a lyar, iniuſt, diſhoneſt, diſloyall, faithleſſe, a Villaine, a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuer, a Theefe, a Traytour, a falſe witneſſe, periured, couetous of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers goods, and a wicked wretch vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his liues end.</p>
               <p>O poor couetous wretch, who would not deplore thine infelicity, beholding thee ſo cruelly tormented, ſo pittifully tortur'd by the mercileſs executioners
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:19962:64"/>
of thine owne goods, and ſo much the more rackt and ſtrapadoed by reaſon of that which thou deſireſt? The earth yeeldeth thee no ſuch fruits: but the ſeeds which couetous &amp; greedy deſire hath ſowne in thy care-furrowed hart, ſpring vp, and produce ſullen ſadneſſe, perplexed thoughts, anguiſh, griefe &amp; vexation of ſpirite. Thy plaints and groanes are without interceſsion: thy frequent exclamation is, What ſhall I doe? Thy plaints declare thy paines, and thy demand the want of a lenitiue for thy languiſhment. O cruell, O ſtrange paſsion I little or nothing dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering from raging madnes: Reader I referre thy deſire of reading more heereof, to the fift chapter of S.

               <p>Ambition is the ſecond branch, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the very next neighbour vnto aua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice. It is a deſire, (inherent naturally in the ſoule) of hauing an apparent glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and eminent ſuperintendency a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue other men. It is not alike in all
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:19962:64"/>
ſorts: but in ſome greater, in others leſſe, according to the variety of their humours, and differences of their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits: for ſuch as are endued with a more ſubtill acuity, and liuely nimblenes of apprehenſion, hauing alſo more lofty and doughty harts, ſomewhat eleua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted aboue the vulgar pitch, and are humourd with nothing more, then with the attemptings &amp; vndertakings of your waightier affaires, and matters of greateſt aduentures, are much more ſubiect vnto this then others.</p>
               <p>In this accurſed poyſon was Adams ſoule firſt ſteeped, by the deceitfull ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifice of Sathan: wherwith being drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken he durſt aſpire vnto Diuinity, not (by the aſsiſtance of grace) recoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the vnſpeakeable benefits which hee receiued from his Creatour; but not contenting himſelfe with his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate and the ſigniory of the whole v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuerſe, which God hath beſtowed on him ouerall the Creatures of the earth and ſea, and ayre, was inflamde with an vnquenchable deſire of making him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe

equall vnto God, who iuſtly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed againſt him, (as well by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of his preſumptuous daring and ſawcy boldneſſe, as alſo for his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfull and a thouſand times worſe then brutiſh ingratitude, debaſed him ſo much the more, by how much the higher he coueted to aduance him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; conſtraining both himſelfe and all his curſed broode to liue in ſuch a ſort, that (now) reſiſtleſs neceſſity com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelleth them to cry out, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe themſelues to bee but men.</p>
               <p>Behold therefore what thy firſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ambitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath gained thee: which aboundeth in vs ſo much the more, by how much the higher we ſtraine to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alt our ſelues aboue the ſpheare of our place and calling. For the exceſsiue, and immoderate deſire of glory is in glorious: And then eſpecially it meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth a double blame, when for the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſfaction and content thereof, it skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth not, whether our endeauours bee eyther honeſt or diſhoneſt, iuſt or vniuſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="111" facs="tcp:19962:65"/>It is very vſuall amongſt ambitious men, neuer to finde any condition of life more diſtaſtefull then their owne preſent: and that is the onely reaſon why they ſo much wiſh for that which is to come. To the atchieuing whereof they alwaies both ſhuffle and cut, tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling al things vpſide downe, bringing in one change in the neck of another, and neuer ceaſe vntil ſuch time as they haue attained vnto the ending period of all their lewd deſires.</p>

               <p>She promiſeth vnto a man a world of felicities, but payes his expectation with ſorrows and repentance: She pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth Crownes, but payeth Croſſes: ſhee exalteth and placeth him on the top of a pinnacle, but to this onely end to caſt him off, and to breake his neck downwards: for the ambitious thoghts of gayning glory (wyping cleane from

by vaine Ambition: but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to know and acknowledge ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely, with an open heart, the ſlender meaneneſs of their poor abilities, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by teaching them to haue an humble and lowly demeanour, in the vertuous acquiſition of true honour; and not to make any dependance or hopefull re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyance vppon the vniuſt and truſtleſſe purpoſes of vice: which by falſe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, vain pleaſures, ſloath and coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſnes, drowns all her fauorites in a ſea of miſeries.</p>
               <p>Voluptuous ſenſuality is the next that followes: which is nothing elſe but a ſmooth tickling &amp; delightful mouing of our carnal appetite, at the very inſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it doth long for the thing deſired.</p>

               <p>And then againe; how many heart-burning moleſtations, ſhall the minde be tortured with, before this imaginary ſhadow of felicity can be attain'd vnto How many and great trauels, how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny heauy perplexities, how many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant griefes, how many importunate ſorrowes, how many tedious lothings and odious deteſtations ſhall interpoſe themſelues betweene man and his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires!

Is it not true, that as ſoone as ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and voluptuouſnes haue maſtered man, in the ſelfe ſame moment of time ſorrow and griefe, anguiſh and annoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, trouble &amp; vexation of ſpirit, hang ouer his head? And by how much the more the Iudgement is infected with this vice; by ſo much the more wicked, and violent, are the affections, and the number of them ſo much the more increaſed: which doe not onely preiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice the internal faculties of the ſoule, but hinder alſo (in a high meaſure) the health and ſafety of the body.</p>
               <p>For, from what cauſe proceede there ſo many noyſom and corrupted humours, ſo many incureable yea ſtrange and vnknowne maladies, as from voluptuouſneſſe, and thoſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed pleaſures, which wee purchaſe alwaies vnto ourſelues with the ſoules perill, and oftentimes with the deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the body which being obtaind, bring with them (without faile) a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand thouſand occaſions of ſorrow &amp; repentance, for one of perfect pleaſure

               <p>In this onelie point the Couetous man becommeth prodigall; and the Ambitious man tumbling headlong from one extreame vnto another, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth like aſwine in voluptuous ſenſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie. For the vnbridled deſires of the voluptuous can not haue any conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſatisfaction, or determinate end: becauſe that inioying one pleaſure for a little while, they (ſhortly) deſire, and wooe a greater, a quainter and a more tickliſh delight: &amp; ſo their wiſhes (being voide of firm reſolution &amp; ſetled con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy) creep ſtil groueling forward, til

they fall into the ſearchleſs depth of diſaſtrous calamity.</p>
               <p>Man through vnlawfull irregular and immoderate pleaſures, growes to bee Intemperate, a Gourmandizer, a lickorous, a ſweet-mouth'd compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, a drunken toſſepot, an incontinent lecher, whooriſh, adulterous, prodigal, effeminate, cowardly, impudent, ſlaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous, ſloathfull, lazy, a gameſter, a poore ſnake, a penurious ſtarueling, &amp; in the end a miſerable wretch.</p>
               <p>So then, the euils that ſprout from theſe three branches, (as from their ſtock) are linked one vnto another (as it were) with a maſſye chayne, which draggeth man vnto all kinds of impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty whatſoeuer, (the end of one beeing the beginning of another) neuer lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing him, vntill ſuch time, as they haue brought him full vnto the gates of hell.

               <p>Wherefore there is no danger or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction whatſoeuer that can befall a mortall man, but is better to bee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergone, then to ſuffer himſelfe to be made a ſlaue to vice; ſithence it is the moſt cruel deteſtable Tyrant that can be imagined in all the world: ſuch a one as neuer giues one minute or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of repoſe and quiet, vnto the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uy ſoule wherein it harboureth.

Yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, this is the difference between our two appetites: The former beeing ſenſuall, may bee defaced in a vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man by a long and a continuall exerciſe of commaunding himſelfe, and his tumultuous paſsions; rendring them obſeruant, and dutiful homagers
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:19962:76"/>
vnto Reaſon, whereby they may bee made conuenient, and capable of all good purpoſes, that there ſhall not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine in him, the leaſt iot of an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uagant motion. Euen in ſuch ſort, that being ſo vtterly extinguiſhed by tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, there ſhall be left no more ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of their being there, then if they neuer had bene there at all.</p>
               <p>The ſecond cannot be ſo vtterly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed but the print thereof will ſtill remaine in all men generally. For a good man deſireth to bee honored for his Vertues: and although he ſeeke not after glory through oſtentation; yet doth he not deſpiſe deſerued prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, or at leaſt vſeth his beſt indeuors to be worthy of the ſame: and for the hauing heereof, his owne merit doth appeaſe his minde.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide: the wicked man deceiuing himſelfe, aſwell in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge of Glory, as in the diſquiſition of the ſame, may bee more fitly ſaide in reſpect thereof to flye from it, then to follow after it. And the feare of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:19962:76"/>
blamed, and branded with baſe ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominy (he alwaies iuſtifying himſelf) maketh vs to diſcerne moſt palpably the great deſire he hath to be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vertuous.</p>
               <p>Both of them tend then towards the prize of honour and reputation. But hauing attainde vnto the angle of Pythagoras, in the which both good and bad actions meete together: the one trauaileth towards the right hand, and the other turneth towards the left; and ſo the ends of this their progreſſe are no leſſe diuers then their waies are different wherein they walked. For de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire is the counterpoiſe of the ſoule, which maketh it incline and weigh downe the balance on that ſide, in the which the will is placed.</p>
               <p>But becauſe our deſires are very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, and are not equall in facility &amp; eaſe, man doth oftentimes deceiue himſelfe in making choyce. For vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuouſnes and ſenſuality follow vs continually, they accompany vs at all times, &amp; in all places, they offer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:19962:77"/>
vnto vs, they court vs louingly, and the meanes to enioy them is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry eaſie. Againe they promiſe vs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, pleaſures, reſt, content, honour and liberty. So that indeed there needs a great deale of conſtancy to preſerue our ſilly ſoules from ruine and deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: and which ſugred perſwaſions to withſtand, we are not onely vrged &amp; pricked forward with ſhame &amp; feare of reprehenſion, but alſo eſtabliſhed &amp; confirmed by the glorious exemplary deeds of ſuch as are truly generous.</p>
               <p>Contrarily, honour is diſtanced a great way from vs: and beſides, the path that leadeth vnto it, is maruailous ſtraight, laborious &amp; painful. Whence it comes that the way (which is onely one) is hard to keepe: it is as toylſome and ſlippery as can bee poſſible. The path of Vertue (through which ſuch as tend towards Honour are to paſſe) is full of pricking thornes, affrighting terrors, tedious irkſomnes, and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous anguiſh. It is ſubiect to the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probrious obloquies of backbiters.
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:19962:77"/>
And laſt of all, the acceſſe thereof is ſo difficult, that it meriteth almoſt to bee called impenetrable.</p>
               <p>Man therefore, when conſtantly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoluing with himſelfe, to proceed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies in that path which leadeth him to the ſtately palace of true Honour, (maugre all painefull and dangerous occurrences whatſoeuer) bequeatheth all delicious ſenſuality, and voluptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous pleaſance, vnto the delicate, neat, ſpruce, effeminate and ſweet faced wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans-man; and wholly dedicates him ſelfe and his indeauors vnto the gau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling labours and (almoſt) intolerable trauailes of ſeuere Vertue.</p>
               <p>It is more then reaſonable, that he (by the generous and feareleſſe reſolution of a noble courage) being arriued vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the fartheſt end of ſo great a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne, ſhould now bee recompenced with a crowne of Honour: for the gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning wherof he enterprizde a iourney ſo painefull ſo dangerous.</p>
               <p>Nature then hath imprinted in the mindes of all, a love of Honour
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:19962:78"/>
and a deſire of prayſe, and aboue all, a certaine opinion that true glory can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be atchieued by any other meanes but vertuous actions. In ſuch ſort that we muſt take eſpecial care not to be ſo vnnaturall, as to priſe glory at a meane value; nor yet to thinke, that ſhee can be acquirde by the wicked actions of impiety.</p>
               <p>Behold therfore the neceſſity both of the theory and practiſe of Vertue: which conſiſteth as well in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and doing of good, (which wee ought alwaies to imbrace and follow) as in the auoydance of that which is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, which we ſhould ſhunne as a veno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous ſerpent. The wound which vice hath ſtabbed in the ſoule, cannot bee cured by repentance alone: but the correction and amendment of our life is alſo required. The griefe thereof ought to be expeld by Vertue, and not by a contraryvice: for the Couetous miſer becomming a Prodigall, tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth headlong from one extream in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to another.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="137" facs="tcp:19962:78"/>Vertue ought to place herſelfe in the very center of the ſouls affections: the ſoule ought to command the ſenſes: and the ſenſes ought to guide the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye; in ſuch ſort as it is by their aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance that the affection becoms from being corporall to be ſpirituall. They are the chariot that tranſlateth this li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing clot of earth, vnto the Temple of Immortality.</p>
               <p>An admirable meanes, had wee ſo great a bleſsing as to be able to attaine vnto the knowledge thereof. Yet farre more admirable, if we could vſe it well. For euen as the life of the ſoul is diuine Grace, and the life of the ſenſes the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of Reaſon: euen ſo the helpfull ſupport of the body hath its whole dependance on the orderly guiding of the ſenſes, beeing aſsiſted by the firſt mouer, whoſe office it is to ſpiritualize them, being brought vnto it.</p>
               <p>For if the ſoule would be contented to liue vnto her ſelfe, without toyling and troubling her ſelfe for her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion, ſhe would depriue her ſelfe of
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:19962:79"/>
all her glory, being not able to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioynd vnto that vnity, (whereunto ſhe aſpireth) by any other meanes but by doing well: So that then her ſalarye wholly depends on the adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and gouernement of the body, for therein onely her action conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth.</p>
               <p>For how can ſhe imploy her ſelfe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe? by what meanes can ſhee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare vnto the world, but by her facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties? Therefore it is very requiſite, that ſhe ayde and ſuccour them, guide and gouerne them, as long as they remaine together; that thereby at length trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phing in glory for hauing vanquiſhed the Diuell, the World, the Fleſh and its affections, ſhee may bring them vnto the fruition of eternall bleſſednes.</p>
               <p>Contrarily, if ſhee (by yeelding too obſequiouſly vnto their luſtfull appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites, and wanton concupiſcences, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting both office and place) ſhould ſlaue her ſelfe to the ſeruile ſubiection of their deſires, ſhee ſhould truely me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit (by ſuffering her ſelfe to bee thus
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:19962:79"/>
tranſported by their lewd and carnall affections) to be depriued of all her ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraignty; foraſmuch as (by giuing too facile an obſeruance to their flattering perſwaſions) ſhe hath fruſtrated the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious intention of her Creatour, which was, that ſhe ſhold aſſimulate vnto her ſelfe by vertuous actions, ſuch things as were impure and ſubiect to the dregs and blemiſhes of ſinne, that ſo at her returne ſhee might bring them with her to bee conioynd in him. The courſe then that ſhee is to obſerue in ſuch contrarieties, is, ſo to demeane her ſelfe, that both the ſenſes and her ſelfe be nothing but Reaſon, that is to ſay, that ſhe be not ſo ſpirituall that ſhe forget her ſelfe to be conioyned with a body, whereof ſhe ought to haue great care, to rule and gouerne it: Nor yet ſo corporall, that ſhe ſhould bee vnmind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of her purer eſſence, and that ſhe is the ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d cauſe of both their felicities. So the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, Vertue producing theſe effects in a prudent ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, impreſſeth in the ſoul of him, not only a knowledge of that
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:19962:80"/>
which is iuſt, honeſt, and profitable, that he may thereby loue and imbrace it; but alſo of that which is vniuſt, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honeſt &amp; vnprofitable, that hee may therby ſhunne and hate the ſame, hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his affections vnder the rule and moderation of her lawes, to the ende that he may not be made a bondſlaue to his enemy, beeing fallen vnder the power of Vice.</p>
               <p>And what is more miſerable in the world then ſeruitude? And what ſerui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude greater, then to be in a ſlauiſh ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection to a mans owne diſordered af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections? On the other ſide, what grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter happines in the world then liberty? And what greater liberty then to bee maſter and commaunder of a mans ſelfe?</p>
               <p>If the victory that is atchieued, ought to bee valued according to the dignity and worth of him that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered, it is moſt certaine, that the Conquerour ſhall bee as greate as was his glory whom hee conquered. In ſuch ſort, the renowned victory
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:19962:80"/>
which <hi>Achilles</hi> wonne when hee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered <hi>Hector,</hi> was ſo much the more noble, by how much <hi>Hector</hi> was more mighty &amp; valiant. Furthermore, there is nothing in the World ſo greate as man, nor any thing in man ſo excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent as his ſoule and courage, which is the greateſt and moſt puiſſant thing within the compaſſe of the Vniuerſe. For queſtionleſs that is chiefeſt, that is nobleſt, which approacheth neereſt vnto the firſt beginning. But the ſoule of man doth moſt reſemble God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of his vnderſtanding, vſe of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and freeneſſe of will, which ſhee hath farre aboue all the parts of mans body, and all other terreſtriall crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures whatſoeuer. Whence it neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly followeth, that the reaſonable ſoule is the moſt worthy, moſt noble, of all the vniuerſall World.</p>
               <p>If man, then, gaine the conqueſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer his own ſoule, he ought to be eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med more victorious then hee that hath ſubdued and conquered the whole world.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="142" facs="tcp:19962:81"/>Wherefore it is, that mans chiefeſt content (during his continuance in this life) is the ſoules quiet and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full tranquillity: which cannot be got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by things directly contrary, ſuch as are reſtleſſe deſires, and greedy co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetouſnes, wherewith the ſoule is miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably tormented.</p>
               <p>Nor yet doth the peace and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity of the ſpirit, properly conſiſt in the exemption of griefe and ſorrow; but alſo, in the freeing of it, from ſuch violent paſſions, as plunge the vicious in a ſea of ſadnes.</p>
               <p>So that then he only is to be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted free, which domineereth ouer his owne affections, and withſtandeth the violence of ſuch ill-ſeaſoned deſires, as without reſiſtance would deſtroy him. If we eſteeme that man to be attended on by an vnhappy chance and a miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable fortune, which hauing bene once a Lord and Commander, is now tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled headlong downe by ſome diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous accident or other, into the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection of his owne vaſſall; what then
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:19962:81"/>
ſhall wee ſay of him that is volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily becomme a ſeruile bond-ſlaue not onely vnto his paſſions, but alſo vnto ſuch things as are ſenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe &amp; dead? (ſuch as are gold and ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, and the like worldly vanities) and ſo at length a ſeruaunt to ſinne and (which is worſt of all) vnto the Diuell himſelfe.</p>
               <p>Is not this a great puniſhment of God, that man out of his owne free will, (for want of knowing and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding himſelfe) ſhould make himſelfe a ſeruant and a ſlaue vnto thoſe things, whereof hee (if hee would eſchewe Vice, and imbrace Vertue, ſo to vſe his goods and fortunes with moderation) might haue the maſtery and full command?</p>
               <p>Therefore if there bee any ſpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle of Iudgement remaining in vs, whereby wee may diſcerne the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous conſpiracies and domeſtical treaſons which our own paſſions, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triue againſt vs, ſhall wee not bluſh to ſuffer our ſelues to bee ſo ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:19962:82"/>
ſurpriſed, by thoſe toyiſh fop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peries, which the leaſt foreſight in the world would vtterly haue queld? Haue our painful indeauors in the ſchool of Vertue gained no greater profit, then that fraile riches, and worldly vanities, ſhould haue greater power and prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence ouer vs then Reaſon? Are we willing our ſelues to deface that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique of Gods image and reſemblance in vs, that we may become wholy bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh? Do we loue &amp; long for that, which wee ought to hate? to imbrace that which burneth vs? and to kiſſe that which conſumeth vs? O, where then is vertues loue, and the affection due to her? O, where is the laudable deſire of Glory and Honour? whereunto all truely generous and noble ſpirits doe aſpire by ciuill demeanours, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable actions.</p>
               <p>Well then, let vs contemne all Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, for Ambitions ſake, ſaue onely that, which by arming our minds with true humility maketh vs ſo valiant a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our ſelues, as to ouercome our

ſelues; in ſuch ſort, that flaying off our old skin with all his ſtaines, blemiſhes, ſpots, and imperfections, we may put on a cleane, a faire and a beautifull skin, not onely laudable for its meeke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, mildnes, patience, liberality, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, modeſty, and fidelity towards all men; but alſo for its fortitude, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy, and Iuſtice towards our ſelues, whereby we may be able to daunt, yea to ſubdue our greateſt enemy, who hath by ſmooth inſinuation, fortified himſelfe euen in the Cittadell of our owne vnderſtanding with a reſiſtleſſe and immutable reſolution of forcing fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs that little little reſidue, that ſmal ſparkle of brightneſs, which ſuruiueth in vs: to the end that beeing altogether in darknes we might with greater faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, ſlide into the ſoul wracking Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribdis of voluptuous ſenſuality; from which, it is almoſt impoſſible to bee redeemed.

For we are inſtructed by nature and

confirmde by experience, that men cannot liue one without another: in ſuch ſort, that from our beginning, our Country, our Parents, our friends, our neighbors, wil, yea ought to be profited by our indeauors. So that wee are not to aſcertain our ſelues of the ſecurity of any other fortreſs in this life, but of doing, counſelling, and ſaying, all ſuch things as are truely accounted honeſt and vertuous: all this being but the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of that dutie and ſeruice which nature obligeth euery one to doe.</p>
               <p>So that then if we will be guided by the direction of Nature, we ought to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for a publique good, &amp; to imploy for the conſeruatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of humane ſociety our goods, our trauailes, our induſtry, yea whatſoeuer is within the liſts of our ability.

               <p>It is alſo requiſit that euery ones pains &amp; induſtry, be accompanied with tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtineſs, and loyalty: to the end that the fruit and profit that the one may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce by the furtherance of the other, be iuſt &amp; honeſt, to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinual main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of humane ſociety; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken away, al things would be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroied by confuſion: ſo that bounty, Iuſtice, truth, &amp; honeſty, would viole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be carried downe the ſtreame, when as priuate gaine ſhould be preferd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the performance of ciuill duty; or when it is deliberated, whether that which is full of profit and commodity may be atchieued, not ſinning againſt honeſty and Vertue.

               <p>As on the other ſide, the moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Vertue and neereſt approaching vnto God himſelfe, is that which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to want as few things as is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible.

                     <l>Externall goods which worldly men adore,</l>
                     <l>Are not cald goods if we them truely name.</l>
                     <l>Subiect they are to change, for euermore:</l>
                     <l>But vertue onely, ſtill perſiſts the ſame.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Wherefore it is, that the liberty and freedome of the wiſe mans ſoule (that knoweth the natures and qualities of external goods) is neuer troubled with their penſiue perplexitie; beeing cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely aſſured that his felicity is not a iot the greater, nor his content any thing increaſed, by beeing inuironed on euery hand, with an infinite maſſe of riches and treaſures, if he haue not the fruition of that true ioy and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, which only proceedeth from the ſoules tranquillity.</p>
               <p>But becauſe we ought not to liue in the world, like idle droanes wee are bound by duty to imploy the talent which God hath beſtowed on vs, to the commodity of diuers others be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides ourſelues, indeauouring to aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the ſame by all iuſt and honeſt meanes, without the dommage &amp; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudice of any; that wee may heereby
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:19962:88"/>
bee true imitatours of the painfull Bee, conuerting all things into ſweete and gentle meeknes, contenting our ſelues with that which is neceſſary, and ſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the reſidue to helpe and ſuccour thoſe that want it.</p>
               <p>For the life of Man, with his indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious paines, is not praiſed becauſe he is rich, and mighty; but becauſe he is iuſt and friendly, and hath the true vſe of the riches which he hath gotten: foraſmuch as liberality is the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent vſe of that meanes, which God hath placed in our hands, to be a helpe and ſuccour vnto many. So that natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall duty (which wee call the ſource of all laudable actions, and foundation of honeſty) obligeth vs, to do nothing againſt the commodity of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon good, nor to ſeek after any thing by the detriment of another; but to render vnto euery one with a good will and a cheerefull countenance, ſuch things as rightly appertaine vnto him.</p>
               <p>For euen as our duty is the end and
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:19962:88"/>
ſcope whereunto Vertue tendeth, to wit that wee ſhould duly reſpect honeſty and a ſeemely carriage in all our acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: Euen ſo it is neceſſary and requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite, that the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modity which accrew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vnto vs by the mediation of our induſtrious and painefull endeauours, be honeſt and profitable both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: becauſe there is nothing profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that is ſeparated from honeſty; this diſiunction beeing the fountaine of al wicked vices.</p>
               <p>So that whenſoeuer wee ſee profit preſented vnto vs, if wee perceiue that there are ingredie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces of vice mixt with it, we ought to eſchew the one, for the others ſake: thinking it to be as full of annoyance vnto the peace of the ſoul, as a ſweet potion mixt with poyſon, to the ſafety of the body.</p>
               <p>For equity and reaſon would haue ſome diſtinction betweene duety, and that which is called commonly profit, there beeing as great a difference and ſeparation betweene them, as there is betweene honeſty and this profite.
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:19962:89"/>
For this kind of profite maketh man not to feare to violate his promiſe, and to profane that which hath been both ordained by the law of God, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmd alſo by the lawes of men; alwaies prouided that it bring him gaine. And the other on the contrary ſide, maketh him (with a liberall and free minde) to imploye his goods, trauailes and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, yea whatſoeuer lyeth within the compaſſe of his ability, to make them profitable and auaileable vnto euery one; not incited thereunto through a certaine hope of a gainefull recompence: although indeed ſuch as receiue any thing, are bound alſo by dutie to bee gratefull to their benefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, and to render ſuch things vnto them for their good deedes, as the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of the benefit requireth, and their abilities can affoorde.</p>
               <p>Yet howſoeuer, Vertue obligeth thoſe that are well ſtorde, to doe plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures vnto others more freely then to receiue, becauſe it is farre more honourable to oblige then to bee ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:19962:89"/>
to giue then to take, foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as hee that conferreth rewards on others, exerciſeth a very good and an honeſt action: but hee that recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth, doth onely exerciſe an action of profite. And profitable is much leſſe gratious then honeſt. For that which is honeſt is ſtable and permanent, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing him that giueth, with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant gratification: whereas that which is profitable, ſlideth quickly away and is ſoone loſt; neither is the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance thereof ſo agreeable and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant to the minde. And againe, thoſe things are eſteemed the more pretious by how much the dearer they are. Therefore it is better to giue then to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, becauſe giuing coſteth more then receiuing.</p>
               <p>Wherefore whoſoeuer hath beene obliged by receiuing, ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme his liberty if hee can poſsible. For it argueth not a vertuous and a valiant ſpirit, to remain long in the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rereages of curteſie. But if wee haue bin beneficiall vnto any, by the friendly

               <p>Yet there is alwaies a regard to bee had (in actions of honeſty) vnto the ſort and quality of the obligation: For a generall good, ought to be preferred before a particular, &amp; a man of merit before ſuch a one as merits nothing. Wherfore, it is, that this deſire is vniuſt and diſhoneſt, which indeauoureth nothing elſe but to extract profit and commodity from euery one, without doing good vnto any one; and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue any kindneſſe whatſoeuer, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſhewing ſo much as a willingnes to
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:19962:90"/>

For indeede it is almoſt impoſſible for ſuch, as vſe all the means they can for the reaping of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, to do that vnto Honour which is her due: Foraſmuch as diſhoneſt gain is a careleſſe regard, nay an abſolute deſpiſall of true glory; the ſhining ſple<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour whereof euery vertuous heart ought to be iealous to preſerue, not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering it to bee eclipſt by the obſcure clowds of baſe actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s; but moſt eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the nobler ſort, &amp; ſuch as haue bin exalted to the higheſt dignities, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by letter, or Armes. For Honour exacts the performa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of duty ſo much the more ſeuerely in thoſe, by how much their worths and dignities haue more diſtinguiſht them fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the vulgar.</p>
               <p>Therefore it is that the golden Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant is not ſo much honoured as the ſimple Souldier. For the one hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth vppe a mountaine of treaſure,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:19962:91"/>
reſpecting onely his owne inriching: the other practiſeth but few meanes, and thoſe alſo as inſtruments of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour: and the onely end of all his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimony, is wholly referred vnto the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſt of Glory.</p>
               <p>And then if naturall Duty haue ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged all ſorts of men, to doe their beſt indeauours (in their ſeueral vocations) to accompliſh ſomthing, that may bee profitable to the publique good; it ſtands with greater reaſon, that ſhee ſhould oblige thoſe, which are the bright lamps, and glorious ſtarres of honour, (eyther by place or paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage) to the end that they might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten the meaner actions of other men, by the ſhining luſtre of their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples. Which they can neuer doe, but by clearing firſt their owne hearts from filthy couetouſneſſe; foraſmuch as that is the principal cauſe, which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth men forgetfull of thoſe thinges which appertaine to the purchaſe of Honour: wholly addicting their minds to riches, and ſuffring the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to think on
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:19962:91"/>
nothing, ſaue that alone, which ſerues for increaſe of their reuenues: wheron being wholly bent, they oft times prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe baſe, and ignoble actions (which in fine, procure their miſerable ruine) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe that are of their own profe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſion. Wherfore it is very expedient for him that deſireth earneſtly to imbrace vertue, to propoſe her alwaies before his eyes, as the onely obiect wherat he aymeth, and not to eſteem of any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, ſaue onely that which is attaind vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to by her accord.</p>
               <p>For how-ſoeuer the impoſturous hypocrite, and diſſembling wretch, ſeeme more faire in his affaires, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the cenſure of the World, then the plaine honeſt and open hearted man; yet certainely it is better to bee vnreſpected with the laſt, then with the firſt to be in great eſteeme. For the ends of ſuch are alwaies miſerable. And therefore they that ſeek after no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but their owne priuate gaine, are miſerably deluded: becauſe whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer their greedy minds induced them
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:19962:92"/>
to follow, was falſe riches &amp; cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>terfeit treaſures. For true riches are not gaind, but by the performance of our duties, grounded on Vertue: which is nought elſe but the practiſe of doing wel to all, not in regard of gaine, or hope of reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, but only in reſpect of Vertue it ſelfe: which is, &amp; ought to be, the ſole profit of an honeſt man. She it is that maketh all things profitable. And hee that taketh care to perform his duty, is neuer guerdor leſs. For the obſeruance therof being wel imployed, procureth vs eſteem &amp; credit amongſt men: cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit preferres vs to the dignity of ſome high place, wherein are gained order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and quiet riches: which are to bee accounted of, farre more then great abundance miſchieuouſly gotten. It is a worthy cement that firmely vniteth honeſt and profitable. For if they bee diſioyned, Vtility is nothing but delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding coſenage: and Ouerreaching, an irreligious policy: which ſeuerely bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the trembling-guilty conſcience to anſwere for the ſame It behooueth
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:19962:92"/>
therefore euery particular man, to bee (as well in art, as induſtry) conſtantly reſolued, and reſolutely confirmed, in three eſpeciall points, before the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieuement, or execution of any acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The firſt is, that his enterprize bee iuſt. The ſecond is, that the meanes which he practiſeth by (for the attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment therof) be lawfull. The laſt is, that he ſurpaſſe not the bounds of his owne vocation, be it eyther publique or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular; but alwaies containe himſelfe within its limits, and do his beſt for the common good. For, than this, there is nothing more agreeable vnto God, nor more beſeeming an honeſt man.</p>
               <p>Let vs then learn our deuoir towards men, to the end that wee may render thanks vnto God for all. Firſt, for the good which he hath giuen vs: next, for the good which wee haue had, to make it truly profitable, &amp; for the proſperous ſucceſſe thereof: and laſtly, for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward which wee are ſure to obtaine: I mean the beatitude &amp; felicity, which is the true ground of perfect goodnes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="166" facs="tcp:19962:93"/>We haue formerly declared, what are Vertues effects in man, (making him to loue and follow her) beſides the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pence which ſhe hath in her ſelf &amp; of her own nature.

               <p>For which cauſe, as many as haue treated of beatitude, affirme that wee ought (if we wiſh for true content, true
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:19962:94"/>
felicity) to deſire perfection. For, none can be ſaid to be truely happy, but ſuch as haue attained vnto the perfect ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of the ſame. Her ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce hath no refere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to the goods honours and pleaſures of the Body: becauſe perfection is not found in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, being fraile, inconſtant, momentary, and lyable to decay, through times ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny. We ought therefore to ſeeke af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Wiſedome, and imbrace the vertues of the ſoule: whoſe condition beeing permanent, and eſtate eternall, they ſcorn the violence of alteration; whoſe conſtancy alſo is neuer mooued with the battering ſtorms of angry fortune.</p>
               <p>So then if all things labour for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and deſire that which is good &amp; agreeable vnto them, it ſtands with greater reaſon that the ſoule of man ſhould couet that which is not onely appertinent, but wondrous neceſſary. The ſoule then being an immortall eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, it is cleare that it ought not to appropriate ſuch things vnto it ſelfe, as are fraile and full of change: but ought
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:19962:94"/>
rather to be richly adorned and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, by ſuch as are permanent and proper only to its owne nature.</p>
               <p>Amongſt all the goods and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of the ſoule, the acquiſition of the Honour which proceeds from vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous actions, whether ciuill or milita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, challengeth the higheſt place; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as the pleaſure &amp; glory which accompany the ſame, are fully accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed with abſolute perfection.</p>
               <p>But becauſe the way of Vertue (through the which ſuch as would at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine vnto perfection, are to paſſe) is neere adioyning vnto that of vice into the which, poor mortal wights (being miſerably deceiued &amp; guld) doe eaſily ſlide, ſithence in very many things there is a great reſemblance twixt ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue &amp; vice (ſo that were not we directed by the infallible guidance &amp; ſafe-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of Reaſon, &amp; liuely rouzed out of dul neglect, by the help &amp; aſſiſtance of vertue her ſelfe) we ſhold too too often take falſe cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>terfeited honor in fled of that which is true and perfect indeede.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="170" facs="tcp:19962:95"/>We ought therefore to take an eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all care, that our ſlight regard in the election, cauſe vs not to erre in the choice thereof. For true Honour is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer atchieued but by Vertue and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of duty, which are as it were its legitimate and naturall parents: without the which, Honour can no more bee, then heate without fire or the ſhadow without the body. For o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe it would bee nothing elſe, but as a fantaſie of Honour, or a bubble of vaine glorie: which is oftentimes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendred in the vaine and deluded i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magination of the diſtempered brain of him which liueth for the world on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; without hauing any reſpect at all, vnto the principall end of his beeing heere, and which neuer attaind vnto ſo much knowledge, as to be able to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne what true Honour is, much leſſe to know how it may and ought to bee atchieued.</p>
               <p>Let vs define it, to bee the ſhining brightnes of a vertuous &amp; worthy ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is reflected from our own

Conſcience, vnto the ſight and view of thoſe with whom we liue.</p>
               <p>It may be alſo called a gracefull reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, or a renowned reputation which euery one ought to haue, in recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of his merit and worthineſſe, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared vnto the world by many great and glorious deedes, approued ſo to be by the generall acknowledgement of all good men.</p>
               <p>It is not then an imaginary fantaſie, but rather a ſplendent brightnes, or a twinkling light, which maketh him that is the ſubiect heereof, and with whom ſhe is enamored, to ſhine as the ſparkling rayes of a pretious diamond.

               <p>And therefore it is not wonne but by ſtriuing (firſt of all) againſt our owne affections, and by conquering them: turning fruitleſſe and toyiſh va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities,

               <p>For thoſe that are born to bee mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified by the enioya<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of honourable &amp; glorious appellations, do neuer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire any thing more ordinarily, more earneſtly, then to performe as many profitable and worthy actions, vnto others, as are within the reach of their abilities; and to ſacrifice their tender hearts laſt drop of bloud to redeeme their Country from an imminent dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger: ſo that their glory beeing thus moyſtned by the honourable effuſion of their owne bloud, it ſhall flouriſh and waxe green in the eternal Spring-time.</p>
               <p>So then the eſteeme and reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which men ſhold deſire, conſiſteth principally in two points. The firſt is,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:19962:96"/>
that we bee alwaies found ſincere and vpright as well towards ourſelues as to all other men; to the end that the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony which commeth from our owne conſciences vnto the ſight and view of thoſe with whom we liue, may ſerue vs in ſtead of a warrant and an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation againſt falſe report: foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as Verity is the ſhield of Honor.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is, to glorifie our ſelues rather by ſurpaſſing others in euery good duty, and office towards them, then by reſpecting of any other ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantages whatſoeuer for our ſelues; be it eyther worldly reputation or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular profit.</p>
               <p>For it is in this duty (which is truely vertuous, truely charitable) that gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and well tempered ſpirits will im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy themſelues (alwaies confined within the limits of their owne vocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) to acquire and poſſeſſe that great &amp; vnualuable treaſure of Honour, that crowne of glory, whereof (hauing once merited it by vertuous deeds) they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer are depriued againe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="174" facs="tcp:19962:97"/>For can any one rebuke thoſe that dayly accumulate deſert vpon deſert, &amp; neuer deſiſt from inriching the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer good deeds, by ſeconding them with the like? ſhewing themſelues to bee truely ſeaſoned with a generous diſpoſition, wiſhing alwaies to encou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter any new occaſions that ſhall bee ſortable to their deſires: greedy of no other glory, beſide the teſtimony of their owne ſoules: diſeſteeming vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the fauourable Iudgement of other men. For euery action is ſo much the more laudable in it ſelfe, by how much the farther off it is from oſtentation, or deſire of applauſe.</p>
               <p>And although it bee not euery ones fortune, to bee able to attaine vnto the height and top of Honour, or to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh it vnto eternity: yet they muſt not therefore bee diſcouraged and exani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated from the purſuit thereof; but thinke that there is no one how mean ſoeuer, but ought to make more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of that little which hee can at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine vnto, in his owne vocation, then
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:19962:97"/>
of all the reſt of his whole wealth and riches; becauſe (in ſuch a caſe) Honor cannot be made altogether immortal, by reaſon of the incapacity of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect: yet howſoeuer; it is the greateſt, the moſt illuſtrious, moſt commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and moſt durable of all the goods which man inioyeth: foraſmuch as by it, he leaueth vnto the world a good te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of his life, and to his owne po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity a good example.</p>
               <p>But foraſmuch as the Qualities, Conditions, and Reſolutions of ſuch generous &amp; noble ſpirits, which make Armes their profeſſion, are different from other eſtates, which neuer trauail but for their owne particular and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate vtilities; whereas theſe heere pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe eſpecially before their eyes, the publique good of the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wealth, aſſuring them a quiet peace, purchaſed by their trauells, their daungers, their wounds, their woes, their greeuous ſufferances, and conſeruing the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall good by their induſtry, valiance and perſeuerance: Honour therefore
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:19962:98"/>
is moſt deſeruedly called the lawfull guerdon, and true recompence of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous actions. For, ſithence Vertue participateth of a diuine nature, it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily followes, that ſhe cannot bee recognized or ſufficiently rewarded with gold or ſiluer; but rather with thoſe things, which draw neere vnto diuinity: ſuch as are Honour and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, rightly appropriate vnto him vnto whom it iuſtly appertaines.</p>
               <p>But it appertaineth vnto none more iuſtly then vnto the gentle, generous, and valiant Captaine: neither ſhineth it ſo magnificently, ſo gloriouſly, in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny affairs, as in the courageous atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> of martial enterpriſes. We behold con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually ſuch as are the legitimate ſons of dantleſs Mars, to be full of courage and ſtomacke euen in their ſwaddling cloathes and afterwards in proceſſe of time to be wiſe in counſell, ſober in neceſſity, patient in aduerſitie, iuſt in the midſt of power, cautelous in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, diligent to follow whereſoeuer fortune leadeth them, deſpiſing eaſe
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:19962:98"/>
and not reſpecting life when it ſtands vpon the point of Honour, not ſetting their valiance at a price, nor his vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous deedes for a mercenary ſtipend; eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chewing alwaies euill, to imbrace what is good, not through fear or force, but through a voluntary and free reſpect of Vertue onely: which (in ſtead of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence) doth crown them with glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, which maketh them ſo remarquea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble aboue other men, as much as the Diamonds value is eſteemed aboue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pretious ſtones: yea as much as the ſunne ſurpaſſeth in glory, the ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry tapers of the firmament: yea ſo much I ſay doth Honour out-ſtrip in true eſteeme, al other earthly treaſures whatſoeuer: whoſe fraile inioyance the world permitteth vs to haue no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, then for the continuance of a flee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting breath. But Honour maketh thoſe that are abſent preſent; yea the dead a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liue, through the freſh remembrance of their noble deedes, tranſlated care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully from age to age, carrying with it ſtill in triumphant ſtate their truly ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:19962:99"/>
and admired actions, borne on the golden wings of pureſt eloquence, that neuer moue, but in the ſeruices of honourable Perſonages.</p>
               <p>This Crowne, therefore, is lawfully due vnto thoſe, that ſpend their liues in the ſeruice of their Prince &amp; coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey; who voluntarily expoſing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues vnto apparant dangers, to ſhield the ſame from forraine inuaſions, bring backe with them many glorious ſcarres, the noble emblemes of an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted courage; together, with a minde-appeaſing teſtimony in their conſciences, of performing faithfull ſeruices vnto their Prince, and of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their beſt endeauours, for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation of their countrey: without the which, it could not chuſe but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure a miſerable languiſhment. For how could life haue beene any way gratefull vnto vs; hauing loſt our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, our Lawes, our Liberty, and our purity of life, which are, next to God, the neceſſary maintenances of our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? So that then theſe things, being
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:19962:99"/>
forcibly rauiſhed from vs, wee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not wiſh to liue any longer in this world.</p>
               <p>This duety, this ſeruice (which they performe towards their countrey) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſo great importance, conferreth on them a deſerued Title of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities; which crowneth them with ſuch ſhining light, as ſhall reflect a ſplendent brightneſſe to poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. For ſithence neither the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, nor the liberty thereof, can bee ſecured, but vnder the protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of defenſiue armes; it conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently followes, that ſuch as make profeſsion thereof, and haue aſſigned themſelues therunto, for the common good and ſafety of their countrey; ſhould not onely be reſpected and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured, but alſo recompenced with an eternall guerdon: in ſuch ſort, that the vertue and proweſſe of an honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble man, hath alwayes beene accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the ſubiect of his Nobilitie; being approued (in all ages) by the common ſuffrage of euery one. So that then
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:19962:100"/>
Honour was giuen vnto men for a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary, a recognizance of ſome vertuous deedes, being a glory vnto him whiles he liued, and afterward a grace tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by deſcent to his poſterity.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>It is great honor from illustrious ligne</l>
                  <l>To be deſcended, by our Predeceſſours:</l>
                  <l>But greater far by our own light to ſhine,</l>
                  <l>(Then by their luſtre) vnto our ſucceſſors.</l>
               </q>
               <p>It behooueth euery one therfore to haue a great regard, that wee obſcure not the ſparkling luſtre of that glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſunne, by degenerating from the vertue of our anceſtors, whoſe deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Honor hath enlightned vs.</p>
               <p>Into which loathſome dungeon of baſe ignominy, ſuch ordinarily preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitate themſelues, as beeing reſpectleſs of their deuoir, preferre their own qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et peace, before their princes ſeruice: and their priuate gaine before their Countries Honour; neuer conſidering that Vertue crownes only thoſe which perſeuere vnto the end. And that man
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:19962:100"/>
ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not immortalize his name on earth, that giueth way to drowſy lazynes: it being vtterly anent reaſon &amp; honeſty, that hee which changeth vertue into vice, ſhould in any ſort bee honored &amp; reſpected: foraſmuch as nobility by birth, can ſtand in no other ſtead vnto ſuch as ſhew themſelues vicious by their ignoble deedes, but to condemne their folly and increaſe their ſhame.</p>
               <p>For vice is ſo much the more defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and vgly, in thoſe of noble races, by how much the patternes of their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers actions are more eminent. In ſuch ſort, that the dead bones and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes of their predeceſſours which bought at ſo deare a price that ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent light, whereby they ſhine ſo glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly in the world, will riſe and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace cruell torments againſt them, if they conioyne themſelues with vice, and her aſſociates, to bandy againſt vertue and her adherents: ſeeking ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance of the wrongs which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue by the participation of diſhonor impoſde on them and on their family,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:19962:101"/>
in recompence of that honour where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they left their progeny illuſtrious.</p>
               <p>Therefore haue armes beene per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted vnto noble perſonages, that they might beare them alwaies, as the recognizance of honour, vnder the confident hope, that thoſe (hauing bin ſuckled in their Cradles with the milke of Honour, and afterwards growne vp in vertue, by the mediation both of Arte, traditions, and examples of their aunceſtors) would not make a league with any that ſhould bee vertues ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; preferring priuate profite, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſeruice of the Prince; and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate gaine before their Countries good.</p>
               <p>For the order of Knighthood was inſtituted in auncient time, to fight in defence of Religion, to defend their countrie, to ſerue their Prince faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully in the warres; being ſent by him vnto the ſame, to maintaine the wron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged cauſes of Widdows, Orphants, and others that are iniuriouſly oppreſt. For to fight for Religions cauſe, is a ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:19962:101"/>
acte, which God will guerdon in the life to come. To defend and protect the countrey wherein we liue, is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the conſeruation of mankinde. To doe ſeruice vnto the Prince, is to cancel the bonds of our naturall allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance. To redeeme the oppreſſed from afflictions and miſeries, is a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble deede, and truely vertuous; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the fruitfull effect of godly chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. For hee that deliuereth not the wronged from oppreſsion, nor oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth himſelfe againſt tyrannie for their deliuerances ſake (hauing meanes, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, limmes, and al opportunity what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer) doth infringe the knot of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane ſociety, which ought to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued inuiolable amongſt true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians: and for neglect hereof, hee ought to be lyable vnto as reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full an infamy, as ſeuere a puniſhment, as hee that hath betrayed his parents and friends vnto a cruell death.</p>
               <p>Wherefore Nobility ought to be in continuall exerciſe, as well in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt of dangerous hazards, in time
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:19962:102"/>
of warre; as in ciuill and honeſt affairs in time of peace, but principally in charitable deedes. For tilting, hunting, running at ring, and the like, are not ſufficient exerciſes, to make your ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue appeare vnto the world: ſhee paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth by ſuch without reſpect, requiring attempts of greater aduenture.</p>
               <p>Great Perſonages haue oftentimes deſired occaſions ful of danger to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent themſelues vnto them; that they might by ſuch vndertakings giue a lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtre vnto the greatnes of their vndaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted courages, whoſe light may bee co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared vnto the ſunne it ſelfe. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, it is not vnto childiſh apprentiſes, or ſimple ignorants, that the conduct and guidance of difficult exploits are committed; but vnto thoſe rather, which by long experience, haue beene made fit and capable of the ſame. For Vertue neuer adorneth any one with wiſedome and modeſty, but ſhee alſo accompliſheth him, with valiance, and magnanimity. Shee taketh from him the feare of danger, of greefe, of ſorrow
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:19962:102"/>
and of death, making him to triumph boldly, treading on the head of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, with the foote of conſtancy, and ſo to direct all his actions vnto Honors glorious title, as the archer his arrow to the white.</p>
               <p>Wherefore if we be men &amp; not mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters in nature, why doe not wee tend towards this perfection? trampling vnder our feet with courageous harts, all the dangerous difficulties which ſtriue to diuert vs from vertues path; ſithence it is by her that wee are truely vertuous, truly bleſſed.</p>
               <p>This worthy reſolution is far more excellent then the poſſeſſion of all the treaſures and honours of the world: which noble and heroick minds con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually deſpiſe, as things fraile, tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, and vaine; and therefore ſeeke af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter felicity &amp; beatitude in things more dureable &amp; permanent. For theſe two, are in the ſoule of man throgh a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary conſequence, of one and the ſame Verity, to wit to bee happy and to bee vertuous: the laſt is as neceſſary vnto
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:19962:103"/>
man, as the firſt is naturally deſired of him. But as the deſire of being hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie is very great, ſo is it alſo very vaine, without this veritie; which teacheth vs that the chiefeſt ſcience in the world is to be an honeſt man, and the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Honour to be happy.</p>
               <p>For Honour, not conformable to vertue, to our duety, &amp; to conſcience, cannot enioy the ſweet ſociety of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect glory, &amp; permanent felicity. And therfore it is nothing elſe, but a windie vapour, proceeding fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſwelling pride, &amp; vain preſumption; whoſe reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pence at laſt is ſhame, hatred, &amp; the deriſion of the whole world, and vnſpeakeable puniſhment in the world to come.</p>
               <p>But that which proceedes from ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, inciteth euery one that is indued with a generous diſpoſition, to erect vnto himſelfe an eternall monument, by glorious atchieuements, &amp; hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icke deedes; arming him with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uincible &amp; courageous conſtancy, to march boldly in the very face of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger it ſelfe; ſuſtayning infinite labours &amp; trauels, tearing through the bryars
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:19962:103"/>
and thornes of a thouſand inconueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies, aduiſing him not to court Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, eyther through oſtentation or ambition: for were it poſsible for him to attaine vnto the end whereat he ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, without indurance, he would not by his good will, caſt himſelfe into an Ocean of perplexities; in ſuch ſort then that he thruſts himſelfe forwards, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe he being dull and groſſe, cannot bee purified of theſe great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brances, but by the fire of afflictions.</p>
               <p>But hauing opportunity now to look backe on the manifolde difficulties which hee hath ſurmounted through the performance of his deuoir, guided by the aidance of a iuſt conſcience hee arriues vnto the field of Honor: where his Temples are crowned with a Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plet of liberty; as truly exempted from the malice both of death and obliui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as his intention was remote from gaine or profite, onely ayming at the good of his cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>try &amp; the ſeruice of his Prince: in ſuch ſort, that he hath pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed vnto himſelfe a renounced me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory throughout all ages.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="188" facs="tcp:19962:104"/>So that then the ſoule finding it ſelfe adorned and beautified with ſuch rich &amp; in eſtimable treaſures, reapeth greate ioy from this great felicity: which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rooted in the very bottome of his hart that poſſeſſeth her (and not in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall and fraile riches) accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the ſoule and the honour thereof, vnto the higheſt heauens, where both ſhal be immortalizde togethers.

               <p>As oftentimes it falleth out in a point of Honour: whereof the greateſt part of men make a vaunting brauado, rather through a vaine ambition of ſeeming greater then other men, then for the true &amp; zealous affection which they beare toward vertue, which they vntruly challenge to themſelues.</p>
               <p>For if Honour bee nothing elſe but the reſplendent glory of a vertuous action, and a celeſtiall good that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, nor will not permit, that any euill deed ſhould be adornde with honours title; how is it poſſible that a man may be called vertuous and valiant, which is not ſtomackfull in anything ſaue miſchiefe, that is neuer armed but to oppreſs the innoce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, neuer doth his vttermoſt but againſt the iuſt, nor enterprizeth any thing ſaue one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that which is quite contrary to the
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:19962:106"/>
generall deſigne of thoſe that deſire peace in ſtead of warre, repoſe in ſtead of ſedition, and louing amity in ſtead of enmitie? Without all queſtion ſuch valiance and adulterate fortitude, whoſe obiect is nothing but bloud and death, is to be accounted no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then a ſauage brutiſhneſſe; nay, farre more beaſtly then that of the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable creatures; which are neuer offenſiue vnto any, ſaue thoſe twixt whom and them nature proclaimes a perpetuall Antipathie: but ſuch as are of the ſame <hi>ſpecies,</hi> doe neuer offend their owne companions.</p>
               <p>But amongſt other ſhames, or rather moſt ignoble and baſe infamies, this is not the leaſt, that a Gentleman ſhould ſtaine his Rapier in the bloud of his neighbour; nay, oftentimes of his own father, and for a trifle, or ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler matter: of ſuch a one (I ſay) with whom before, hee made but one bed, vſed but one table, but one purſe. Tell me, I pray, whence proceedes this falſe and baſe imagination in thee, that
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:19962:107"/>
thou thinkeſt true Honour to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in ſurpaſsing others by ſtrength of body, and in making the weake to tremble at thy feete? Or that he is not to be eſteemed valiant, that inſulteth not imperiouſly ouer another, or aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulteth not anothers life, or ſheds his bloud? Falſe and counterfeit Honour, is the father of thoſe adulterate brats. For ambition alſo; being one of falſe honours ſonnes, is neuer quarrelleſſe; each one would haue the place, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one conteſts with his companion for the chiefetainity; ſtriuing with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery Oare one to debaſe another; in ſuch ſort that the moſt deſperate ſtick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſneaging Cauallier, is held with them to be the ſtouteſt gallant. And at this very day, vertue is transformed into vice, and true valiance into raſhneſſe; not without the approbation of all; or (at leaſt) the moſt part, apologizing onely in this manner: It is my duety to defend mine honour. Aduiſe your incenſed gallant, to any other courſe beſides fighting, he ſweares, tis ſimple,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:19962:107"/>

He ſweares, he wil be reueng'd: &amp; the furious flames of his diſtempered mind, muſt be extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed with his friends heart bloud: take this, and take all; his Honour is more pretious then his life: he had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tranſlate his name vnto poſterity vnblemiſhed, then liue to ſucke a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yeares light ayre.

and laſt of all, rather to pardon all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gracefull wrongs, then to be reuenged on any one. For the greateſt reuenge, the honourableſt victorie that we can gaine ouer our enemies, is, to ſurpaſſe them in diligence, in bountie, in mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimity, in good &amp; courteous deedes; wherewith they will ſooner know and acknowledge themſelues conquered, and conſtrained to ſhut their mouths, and to bridle their contumelious tongues, then by any other forcible courſes whatſoeuer.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, a vertuous man is not to conſider any other thing in all his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendments, but whether they be iuſt, or vniuſt, good, or euill; to the end that by reaſons iudgement, he may be able to diſcerne the truth from falſhood, and to declare, that he propoſeth vnto himſelfe, no other end, but iuſtice and equity.</p>
               <p>And therfore, ſuch as ſubiect them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, to the indurance of labours and trauels, for iniuſt cauſes; or fight de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperately for peculiar profite, vnder
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:19962:108"/>
what pretence ſoeuer, being not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded through the ſincere loue of vertue alone; cannot brauado it, or ſwagger it out (but falſely) that they are indued with ſuch worthy qualities, as ar truly requiſit to a generous mind. For ſuch a victory, as is bought with the bloud of thoſe, which haue very ſlenderly, or happely ſcarce offended vs at all, is an exquiſite defeature of true renowne: but the other is farre more noble, and farre (beyond compariſon) more commendable, in that he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to ouercome himſelfe, in giuing pardon to his enemies. For the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber is but ſmall of thoſe which are found to be ſo iuſt, that they can eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forget, and ſlightly ouerpaſſe great iniuries receiued; that being a peculiar property vnto the magnanimous, and truely noble courage: which ſhewes himſelfe angry with him alone, which ſeeketh to ſtaine the glory of his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, by the iniurious and diuelliſh im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations of ignoble deedes. In ſuch ſort, that to pardon theſe inſolencies,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:19962:109"/>
and to forget ſuch apparant wronges, acted by thoſe, on whom hee may with facility reuenge himſelfe, is a deede that merites noble praiſe, and is onely proper to a vertuous and heroicke ſpirite; who is both able and willing to repreſſe the fury of his paſsions, crying for reuenge, and not to recompence ill deeds for ill. Not that it ſhould not be lawfull for a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman or a Souldier, to demand a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the wrong which is offered vnto him, and moſt eſpecially in an action of honour, which was gained by mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary proweſs: but yet too, he ought to proceed in the managing hereof in ſuch ſort, as his own co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience may alwaies ſerue as a ſufficient teſtimony of the truth and equity of his quarrell: which ought alwaies to be grounded on a iuſt cauſe; and ſo to cleere the blemiſhes of his reputation by lawfull meanes, and honourable ſatisfactions. For whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer groundeth his quarrell on no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or requireth greater ſatisfaction then he ought, diſhonoreth himſelfe;
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:19962:109"/>
for as much as Honour conſiſteth in the entire diſcharge of duetie: which obligeth vs not to doe any thing, contrary either to equity or our owne conſciences, vnder what co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour or pretext ſoeuer; neyther tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough feare of torments, or death it ſelfe; but to continue firme and conſtant, in the laudable action and perfect vſe of vertue, addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting our ſelues wholly to ſuch things as are iuſt, honeſt, and ſeeme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for their owne ſake, and bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not prouoked by any other meanes.</p>
               <p>For Honour cannot ſubſiſt where vertue is defectiue: neyther can ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue iuſtifie this title, except the ground thereof bee veritie; becauſe the Court of verity is Honors throne. In ſuch ſort, that a mans honourable reputation is much blotted, if when hee receiues the Lie, he free not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe of that ignoble imputation: becauſe vertue being founded on veritie, it followes that as ſoone as
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:19962:110"/>
verity is deficient, vertue alſo faileth; and ſo by conſequence our honour is loſt. Therefore a man without verity, is vnfurniſhed of Honour; but hauing it, can neuer be diſhonoured, by what wrong ſoeuer.</p>
               <p>Wherfore a prudent man, will neuer giue the <hi>Lie,</hi> without mature delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; knowing full well, that he ſhould preiudice his owne reputation, if hee ſhould ſlaunderouſly doe it, without a neceſſary and iuſt occaſion. He is not ignorant that the ſequele of ſuch a word vntimely ſpoken, will be figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and ſwaggering, or rendering ſome other ſufficient ſatisfaction vnto the party (in ſuch ſort) abuſed: ſo that hee will temper the heate of his choler with ſober meekeneſſe; doing nothing in momentary paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which afterwards ſhould cauſe him to repent.</p>
               <p>And as it is farre from his intent and will, to be offenſiue vnto any, eyther in word or deede; ſo alſo he takes eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall regard, that all his purpoſes be ſo
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:19962:110"/>
ſurely founded on reaſon and verity, that his diſtaſtefull wordes doe not miniſter iuſt occaſion of exception, vnto any of thoſe, with whom he vſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is conuerſant.</p>
               <p>For although ſuch a one, to whom the lye is giuen iniuſtly, and without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny reaſon, cannot abſolutely loſe his Honour and reputation; yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding it preuaileth oftentimes ſo farre with many, that it maketh an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsion in their phantaſie; inducing them to thinke, that he which hath in ſuch a manner receiued it, is a man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute of vertue, being taxed to be a man without veritie: ſo that the vulgar (which vſually are more inclinable to euill, then vnto good) cannot bee perſwaded, to imagine any other thought of him but euill, as long as theſe his wrongs remaine vnſatisfied.</p>
               <p>In reſpect whereof, the <hi>Lye</hi> vniuſtly giuen, is a great offence, both to the heart and honour, of him that recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued it.</p>
               <p>For to ſpeake properly, and within
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:19962:111"/>
the tearmes of Reaſon; No one can worke another mans diſhonour, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept he firſt diſpoile him of his vertue which accompanieth him, and with whom Honour dwels continually. A man may take a weapon from a man, how ſtout and valiant ſoeuer he bee, and ſo diſarme him: he may receiue a boxe on the eare, a baſtonado, or a crackt crowne; becauſe theſe are chances, which oftentimes manhood cannot withſtand: it being moſt true which is vſed prouerbially, <hi>Qui con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptor eſt vitae ſua Dominus eſt alienae:</hi> That he that regardeth not his owne life, becomes by his deſperateneſſe the Maſter of another mans. But a wiſe &amp; prudent man cannot bee ouercome, arming himſelfe with vertues ſhield; which can neuer be taken from him that doth poſſeſſe her. And therefore indeede there is no one that can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priue a man of his honour; ſaue hee himſelfe, by ſequeſtring himſelfe from vertue, and verity, to addict himſelfe wholly to vice and falſhood.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="203" facs="tcp:19962:111"/>Be thou then vertuous, &amp; thou ſhalt be honoured; neither ſhalt thou neede to feare of being diſhonored by yniuſt diſgraces. For it is a treaſure that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be taken away from the vertuous; who affect not praiſe for oſtentations ſake, but loue. Honour onely is the guerdon of their merite; which ought alwaies to be iudged and approued by the graue and vertuous, and not by the vulgar ignorants; much leſſe by the vitious and quarrelling Hackſters: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the opinions of ſuch are ſtill ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected; as well becauſe they want iudgement, to diſcerne vertue from vice, as alſo becauſe the affections of the vulgar are ſo full of corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that ordinarily they loue, they deſire euill more then good.</p>
               <p>Wherein all the ambtious pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuers of falſe Honour, doe moſt apparantly bewray theſe follies. For wee ſhould account him a ſenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe Idiot, that ſhould queſtion a blinde man concerning the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of his Cloake; and yet wee
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:19962:112"/>
doe not conſider, that when we depend vpon the raſh approbation, and brain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe cenſure of the wauering and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtant multitude, wee referre the iudgement of our Honours and Liues, vnto ſuch ignorant Simplicians, as haue no inſight at all in things, that are worthy eyther of praiſe, or diſpraiſe.</p>
               <p>Therefore ought we onely to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe the cenſures of the vertuous and grauer ſort of men; who conſider the honour of another, as if it were their owne, and neuer conſent that any ſhall be honoured, but thoſe, whoſe vertue duely challeng'd it. For indeede wee erre as often as we weigh the vertuous actions, and honourable deedes of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, in the vniuſt balance of our owne paſsions: and therefore wiſe and honeſt men ought to be obſeruant of the merite, and not eyther to praiſe or diſpraiſe the ſame, for the Actors ſake; becauſe our paſsions ouerthrow our iudgement, and cauſe our cenſures to be iuſtly deemed vniuſt.</p>
               <p>He is iudged vnworthy of Honour,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:19962:112"/>
that proffers wrongs and iniuries vnto others: nay, he is the Authour of his owne diſhonour; declaring by his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions vnto the world, that his breaſt enfoldeth within it a malignant, and a wicked ſpirit, to doe ſuch deeds as want the ſupportance and patronage of Reaſon.</p>
               <p>For all circumſtances being well conſidered, there can be no ſufficient reaſon found, why men ſhould wrong and iniure one another: ſithence God hath endued man with iudgement, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with reaſon; by whoſe helpfull aſsiſtance he ought to decide all differences whatſoeuer, and not to conclude them with reuengefull cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eltie: becauſe iniury and reuenge is properly an vniuſt action, or a deede without reaſon; which cannot proceed from a generous minde: to whom it is more agreeable, to receiue wrong it ſelfe, then to proffer iniury and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace to others.</p>
               <p>So that the firſt cauſe, which inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gateth the heart of any to be iniurious,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:19962:113"/>
can be nothing elſe, but iniquity and baſe villanie; which is the true ſource of vniuſt and diſhoneſt actions. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is to be reputed diſhoneſt and moſt vnworthy of honour &amp; eſteeme, that is the willing Author of anothers vniuſt diſgrace: &amp; ſuch a one ought to be diſeſteem'd, nay, deſpiſed of al men; vnleſſe he giue iuſt and conuenient ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction vnto the partie iniured, without conſtrayning him to right himſelf by combat in the field. Which if he refuſe to doe, it is moſt certaine that the iniury and diſgrace, returneth vnto him that eyther did it, or ſpake it; euen as the duſt flyeth vp into the eyes of him that bloweth on the ſame.</p>
               <p>Yet howſoeuer, as euery one ought to haue an eſpeciall regard, not to vrge any with iniurious wrongs, &amp; then to raiſe an vniuſt quarrell on ſuch vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full grounds: ſo alſo hauing proceeded ſo farre, that he hath vndertaken it, he muſt be careful on what conditions he deſiſt therefrom. For both the one and the other, is preiudiciall to his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour;
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:19962:113"/>
which ought alwayes to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed vnto the conſcience, which is the infallible touch-ſtone of truth: in ſuch ſort, that we muſt not be wilfully obſtinate in the eager purſuit of an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſt quarrell, being accuſed by our owne conſciences. For ſithence veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is ſuch, that no man can liue vnfaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in this world, he is to be accounted worthy of greateſt praiſe, that moſt carefully obſerueth it; and hauing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined, redeemes his errour, by ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring due and rightfull ſatisfaction for the ſame. Wherfore he is ſo farre from meriting any blame, that oftentimes he augmenteth his honour and repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, becauſe like a man he gouernes himſelfe by the lawes of reaſon &amp; mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty; there being nothing more vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſt, more diſhoneſt, then ſcornfully to reiect or diſeſteeme the ſame; for that a man is only a man, as long as the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his life are guided by the addreſs of Reaſon. For that w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is atchieued by her helpful directions, is ſeemely, and good, &amp; alwaies praiſed of all: but that
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:19962:114"/>
which is attempted without her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, is vnſeemely and naught, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies blamed of all. Therefore let vs ſay:

               <p>But if his Honour be reproached, and his reputation defamed, hee is much iniured; &amp; in righting himſelfe for ſuch a diſgrace, he ſeeketh ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, ſo much the more diſcreetely, the more worthily, by how much his courſes are more conformable to the lawes: which neuer conſtraine any one to endure that, which is a blemiſh vnto his name, and a ſpot vnto his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowne.</p>

               <p>Beholde then why vertue (which is not a fained or an imaginarie point) is touched to the quick, when as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie one endammageth the meanes of her performances, vvhich haue dependaunce on the bodie and

               <p>But vvhen the iniurie by deede pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth from ſwaggering, brauado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and audacious temeritie; ſuch a fantaſticall and capricious humour is ſo irregular, ſo immoderate, that the repreſsion thereof deſerues no meane reward: and then ſpeciallie, vvhen the rebuker ſhall not haue anie pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar intereſt therein. But when the diſgrace or iniurie is directed vnto him, he is ſo much the more earneſtly prouoked, by how much the more his courage &amp; manhood is called into que<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the ouerweening faucines of the offender.

               <p>This ought to be vnderſtood to be amongſt men of equall ſtrength, or betweene ſuch as are of ſmall diſparity. For if the greater outbraue the leſſer, the infamy redounds vnto the aſſaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; becauſe the inequalitie of ſtrength debarres him, from the meanes of working his reuenge. And no action that is conſtrained, can beget diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; no more then an action can be honourable that is not free.</p>
               <p>Touching the iniury by word; it is eyther reproachfull detraction, or gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing foppery: for both the one and the other, hath a bitter reliſh in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous apprehenſion of a generous ſpirit.</p>

And although this aſperſion be full of vntruthes, yet notwithſtanding it ſhakes the whole Fabricke; in ſuch ſort, that it is alwaies ready to tumble downe, and cannot eaſily be reduced vnto its former eſtate againe. For Honour ought to be ſtill preſerued ſo pure, ſo ſpotleſſe, that it ſhould be free from the leaſt blot or blemiſh whatſoeuer.

               <p>The vprightnes &amp; equity of a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel grounded on words ſolely depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth on the intentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the ſpeaker; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is it that determineth al our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, al our ſpeakings, either to be good

or euill. For euen as the will giueth motion vnto the members, whereby they ſtirre and doe any thing: euen ſo the intention is the firſt beginner, of eyther the good, or the euill, which they doe.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, beſide the intention, this equity may be reſtrained vnto certain circumſtances; which a man of worth, and great eſteeme (which ſhould not auoide combate onely, but debate alſo and contention) ought to conſider be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he imbarke himſelfe, into any raſh and vnaduiſed quarrell; yea, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the wickedneſſe of the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion were apparantly diſcerned. For he that ſpeaketh, doth oftentimes vſe ſuch generall termes: ſo that if any one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret them particularly to concerne his owne perſon, hee is vniuſt in his quarrell, and offereth iniury vnto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. For applying them to his owne life, and ſeeming to be much nettled thereby, he doth nothing elſe but proclaime himſelfe culpable by his owne detection; and induceth others
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:19962:119"/>
to beleeue, that the ſting of his owne conſcience vrgeth him within, and ſo enforceth him to ſearch outwardly for an excuſe, before he be accuſed. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is neyther lawfull nor honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, to except againſt any wordes, which may by any meanes beare an interpretation of pleaſant mirth.</p>
               <p>But aboue all wordes of baſe diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, that is reputed to be moſt offenſiue, which accuſeth a man for breaking his word; becauſe it is moſt vnlawfull for vs (although it be with great preiudice) to violate our faith, or to faile in performance: for (our pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate intercourſe amongſt men, wholly depending thereon) he that falſifieth his faith, or credite, doth deale trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherouſly with a publique ſociety, and diſſolueth all the bands of commerce and amity. Againe, hee that paſſeth his word and credit, and yet obſerueth them not, maketh himſelfe a lyer; and ſo conſequently depriueth himſelfe of that honour, which no man but him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, could robbe him of: and by the
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:19962:120"/>
ſame meanes drawes vnto himſelfe a note of cowardiſe, and perfidious trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery. Therefore if a falſe and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged imputation be a ſufficient and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full cauſe of quarrelling, the promiſe-breaker then giues iuſt occaſion of the like reuenge. For, this is to tax him with an argument of diſeſtimation, whereof it concerneth him to cleare himſelfe. And therefore a man being accuſed of perfidiouſnes, ought to doe the vttermoſt that hee can poſsible to make the contrary appeare vnto the world through iuſt &amp; lawful meanes: to the end that he may redeem his doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful reputation from ſo foule a blemiſh.</p>
               <p>There are other kinds of quarrells which are grounded only on iealous ſurmiſes, which oftentimes are found amongſt your vniuſter ſort. For the firſt motion heereof proceedes from enuie, which neuer harbours in a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble breaſt, and ſuch a one as is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly borne: whom it behoueth to excell all others in all kinds of woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy qualities, and to loue vertue with
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:19962:120"/>
ſuch a ſincere affection, that all ſuch as are indued therewith, ſhould be deare and pretious in his ſight; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore farre from contemptible hatred.

Whoſoeuer quarrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth with any through enuie, is a teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie to proue (againſt his owne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) the honeſty of him with whom he contendeth; and giueth thereby a ſufficient ſhew vnto the world of the wrong, vvhich he offereth him, foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as no one can iuſtly complaine againſt a vertuous man. Behold ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore what the foundation whereon the greateſt part of quarrells are whollie grounded. I haue not vndertaken here to declare vnto you the order &amp; maner of proceeding in them, nor yet the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for the determinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of them being entred into; but the remedies alone of auoiding &amp; flying fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> aſwell in not departing from vertue, by doing ſuch

It is a raging tempeſt, that breaketh downe the maſts and rudders of our liues; tumbling and toſsing our fraile barkes, in the ſoule-ſwallowing ſurges of our franticke furies; renting the cardes of our conuoye, and taking from our ſight the ſtarre of our direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and leaueth with vs neither help nor hope.</p>

               <p>Temeritie is the accurſed inuerter of equity and iuſtice in man, conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning him both to doe and ſay al things without reaſon, al things without coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell.

               <p>Light beliefe is alſo an eſpeciall cauſe of choler.

               <p>The meanes of remedying this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, is to anticipate our choler, and to range it according to the direction of reaſon; and not to attend it till the rage be kindled: but at the ſelfe ſame point of time aſſoone as we haue any ſenſible perceiuance of any alteration in our ſpirits, or that the pulſes of our hearts haue ſomewhat a nimbler and a ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger motion then appertaines to a good and perfect temperature, wee ought to doe vnto it as to a fire, which wee quench with all diligence, aſſoone as it is kindled; not look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on it, till it hath ſeiſed on the ioyſts and rafters of the houſe: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, when all things ſhould bee im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced by the fearefull and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileſſe flames, it is in vaine to

In like manner wee ought not to deferre the application of our remedy, till ſuch time as wee be ſcorcht, and burnt, with the furious flames of our incenſed choler: but, euen when we perceiue paſsion within vs, and occaſions without vs, egging and ſpurring vs forwards to this fierie rage, wee muſt at the very inſtant im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy all the faculties of our ſoules, to mainetaine our ſafety, and to reſiſt the violence which aſſaulteth vs. For there is a meane to preſerue our ſelues there-from (as from a Tyrant) by not yeelding obedience at firſt, nor ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it to haue any power or authority ouer vs. But if we giue it time and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to extend and fortifie it ſelfe, it will get the ſtart of vs, by little and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and at laſt become to bee inuinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>

and ouercome by choler? and that pleaſant conceited ſyllable, or a little word ſlipping out vnawares, ſhould ſo vvaſpe vs, and ſo farre tranſport vs beyond our ſelues, that wee ſhould ſeeme not to haue aſmuch as one ſcruple of eyther conſtancie or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon?</p>
               <p>Let vs therefore learne to barraca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do the doores of our hearts, againſt the forcible aſſaults of choler; fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them ſo ſecurelie on euery quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that it may haue no incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to attempt to enter. For there is no heart more valorous, or courage ſtouter, then that, which can repreſſe the fury of his paſsion: nor worthyer trophies them thoſe, which maie bee procur'd from our ſelues: nor tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs more glorious or magnificent, then when our reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> can lead our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered affections as ſlauiſh ſeruants and ſeruile captiues. Which if they could preuaile, and get the victorie, they vvould inſult like bloudy minded Tyrants ouer vs; taking away by cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:19962:126"/>
violence, the peacefull tranquillitie and pleaſures of the ſoule, which ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue giues to Honour, as ſolacing aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciates; being the chiefeſt, the comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableſt companions, that mans heart can wiſh for.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>LL men naturally deſire pleaſure and eaſe; and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in the world to no other end, but to ſettle themſelues in ſuch an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, as may crowne their affections with content. All their practiſes and indeauours, all their plots and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſells, all their reſtleſſe purpoſes, and
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:19962:127"/>
painefull enterpriſes, aime at no other marke but this. But who is it that fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth what hee ſearcheth for? Euerie one complaines on the miſery of his owne condition, and bewailes the peruerſitie of his froward fortunes, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming the world by theſe his dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full moanes, that he continues ſtill vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfied.</p>
               <p>The reaſon hereof is, becauſe hee ſeeketh in this life, that which is not heere; and therefore it is impoſsible to be found. They ſearch with watchfull eyes, and reſtleſſe hearts, that celeſtiall pearle, in the dunghill of the world, which is reſeru'd in heauen, for thoſe that will exclaime againſt the vanities of the world, and the fraile incertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of all things therein: for thoſe (I ſay) that bend all their ſtudies, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpate the loue and liking, which they beare towards the world, out of their hearts and minds, preſenting them by the aſsiſtance of vertuous contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, vnto the GOD of heauen; In whom they obtaine (as in a hauen of
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:19962:128"/>
ſecuritie) that ſweet repoſe, and quiet comfort, which they ſought in this life, with an earneſt &amp; vehement, but a fruitleſs purſuite. For we learne by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible demonſtrations, deduced from the knowledge of our owne ſelues, that this life on earth, is but as it were a pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage, a ſhort (yet tedious) iourney, whereby we trauell, or tend towards another place, which is celeſtial: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wee ought to demeane both our ſelues, and ſubſtances, with ſuch a golden moderation (whether it bee in giuing ſatisfactions to our vrgent neceſsities, or elſs in our pleaſances &amp; delightful recreations) that al conſpire for the aduancement of vs, vnto that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place which is the celeſtial treaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of our ſoueraigne good.</p>
               <p>It is a thing maruailous ful of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficultie to be attain'd vnto: but being gained, it is as ful of profit, eaſe, and pleaſure; yea ſuch a thing, as in the acquiſition whereof, no paines or perills ſhould ſeeme hard, or feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="237" facs="tcp:19962:128"/>For, this is a prize ſo precious, that the leaſt and meaneſt particle thereof, is throughlie ſufficient (of it ſelfe) to recompence a worlde of paines.</p>
               <p>And becauſe the remonſtrances and characters which may bee compoſed, ſetting forth vertues beauty and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie, gentlie inuiting vs to imbrace her; and the manifold diſcourſes of vice ſhewing vnto the world her vg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, monſtrous, and deformed ſhape, enforcing vs to deteſt and hate her; are not ſufficient remedies to cure our depraued paſsions, and to appeaſe the perturbations of our ſpirits; pleaſures and paines are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd vnto vs in the ſchoole of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, to be the Directrices of al our acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; the one ſeruing as a rewarde and ſalarie to encourage vs to vertue, the other as a torture to deterre vs from vice: for there are no intendments, or actions eyther plotted or perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, but it is through the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:19962:129"/>
and reſpect either of the one or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>It remaineth therefore, in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion and vpſhot of this little tract, to repreſent vnto you, what and how wondrous great the delectation and pleaſure is, which a vertuous man rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth in the inioyance of this rich and great treaſure of honour and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, which vertue endoweth him with very profuſely heere in this life, but moſt aboundantly in the life to come. Let vs therefore knowe, what pleaſure and delectation is.</p>
               <p>Wee define it to be a contentment, ful of pleaſure and delight, proceeding from a perfect action, accompanied with the knowledge and vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding thereof.</p>
               <p>Senſible creatures are capable of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: but becauſe it is without the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of ſuch things as they doe, they cannot haue any delectation thence.</p>
               <p>Yet notwithſtanding euery action, done with knowledge, doth not beget
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:19962:129"/>
pleaſure and delectation. It muſt bee perfect alſo, if you will haue it pleaſant. For imperfection, and defect, breede alwayes more diſpleaſure, then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent.</p>
               <p>Two things are neceſſary to the perfect accompliſhment of an acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and ſo by conſequence to the frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of pleaſure.</p>
               <p>A good conſtitution, in the faculty that worketh, and in the obiect alſo whereon it worketh.</p>
               <p>There is ſmall comfort in looking on any thing, when the eye is badde, and the obiect worſe. And poore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent (God knowes) ſhall a man enioie in hearing, when as the eare is (almoſt) deafe, and the muſicke dull: But if the proſpectiue which we beholde, be full of glory, and the eye good, the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick curious, and the eare acute, then ſhal our eie content vs with beholding: and our eare with hearing. The like may bee ſaid of the other ſenſes. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore all delectation is not indiui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duall: for there are diuers (yea as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie)
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:19962:130"/>
ſorts of them, as there are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect actions done vvith vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</p>
               <p>Euery action that is ioyn'd vvith knowledge, iſſueth from the ſenſes, and is perfected by them. Thence it is, that there being in man two ſorts of ſenſes, ſenſes of the bodie, and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the ſoule: there are alſo found in him, two ſorts of actions, one of the body, the other of the ſoule: and two kinds likewiſe of delectations; the one corporeall, the other ſpirituall.</p>
               <p>The delectation of the body, is exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, and proceedeth from the perfect actions of the externall ſenſes, which are fiue in number (euery one of them hauing a delectation proper vnto it ſelfe, and which it moſt affecteth) to weet, ſeeing, hearing ſmelling, taſting, and touching: ſo that there is nothing more admirable amongſt the workes of nature, then the ſenſes naturall combination, and their ſubiection to the body.</p>
               <p>The ſpirituall delectation is inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall,
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:19962:130"/>
and iſſueth from the perfect acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the faculties of the ſoule: ſo that, the more perfect the action is, the more pleaſant is its delectation: And by how much alſo the facultie is more excellent, and the obiect more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, ſo much the perfecter ſhall the action bee; and ſo by conſequence ſomuch the greater ſhal its pleaſure be.</p>
               <p>Wherefore it followeth, that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectation which proceedeth from the perfect actions of the ſoule, doth farre ſurpaſſe the other, iſſuing from the actions of the body: becauſe the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and faculties of the ſoule are farre more efficacious and excellent then thoſe of the body, according to the proportion of the ſoule aboue the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, &amp; as much as the obiect of the ſoule (which properly is vertue and veritie) doth ſurmount in excellency all the obiects of the corporeall ſenſes: ſo that the true ioy, true peace, and true reſt of the ſoule (wherein only conſiſteth true and perfect pleaſure) beare great correſpondency with truth &amp; vertue.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="242" facs="tcp:19962:131"/>There is no delectation then, which is truely worthie to be deſired by man, but that which proceedeth from the actions of the ſoule; that onely being peculiar vnto him, ſithence beaſts participate of all other as well as he.</p>
               <p>And albeit the body haue its diſtinct pleaſures apart from the ſoule, yet they cannot be either truely pleaſant or laudable in man, if they be not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd within the precincts of modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and vertue.</p>
               <p>I will grant a man to haue as acute an eye as the ſharp-ſighted Lynx, and that hee ſtand contemplating on the faireſt, the moſt admired obiect of the world, hee may certainely conceiue ſome pleaſure from ſuch an action: but if it be wanton, lewd, erronious, too much, or to a wicked end, that action neither is, nor ought to be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd laudable. For their is no true and laudable pleaſure without perfection, nor any perfection but within the liſts of vertue.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, amongſt corporall
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:19962:131"/>
pleaſures ſome are natural, others vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and ſuperfluous.</p>
               <p>The naturall pleaſures are indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, and are either good or bad, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their vſe and end vnto the which they are referd. For being vſed with mediocritie, and applyed only vnto their owne proper end (which is preſeruation of health, and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the bodies perfect diſpoſition) they are then (without queſtion) wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be prais'd; much leſſe then, to be either reiected or deſpiſed.</p>
               <p>Such as ſhew themſelues to bee of too auſtere and rugged a diſpoſition, in the inioyance and vſe of naturall pleaſure, are too too extreame. For God did not make the creatures of the world only to ſerue vs, and our neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities; but that they ſhould alſo afford vs pleaſure and delight. Which may eaſilie be proued by the varietie of the manifold and curious colours, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſity of harmonious ſounds, the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences of pleaſant taſtes, and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitie of fragrant ſmells, which hee
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:19962:132"/>
particularly hath appropriated vnto e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery kinde of creature; ſhewing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to haue had more regard to giue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent &amp; pleaſure to our ſenſes, then food and ſuſtenance vnto our bodies.</p>
               <p>Whence it may be inferd, that ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluity (which is both vaine and vicious in all things being eſchewed, we ought not to refuſe or ſhew our ſelues diſdain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, to accept the honeſt pleaſures and moderate delights, which God doth offer to vs in his Creatures; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are not eyther to be reiected or deſpiſed.</p>
               <p>The ſeuere Stoickes (which would haue the deſires of men euen in theſe moderate inioyances of delectation, to be ſtupid and ſenſeleſs) are as ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cenſured, as the diſſolute and looſe Epicures, vvhich take from their ſtrong-headed affections, Reaſons bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle; being alwayes too tractable to the vaine inducements of ſenſuall appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite.</p>
               <p>For ſuch as would depriue man of his naturall affections, becauſe they
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:19962:132"/>
diſpoſe and allure him vnto certaine vices, may be fitly likened vnto thoſe, that obſtinately maintaine, that none ought to drink wine, becauſe often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it makes ſome men drunk; or that a man ſhould not ride a gallop, for that diuers men haue beene deſtroyed thereby.</p>
               <p>But what ſhould become of vs, if we were intirely deſpoyled of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall affections? We ſhould haue no more power to turne either to the one hand, or the other, then if a dead palſie had benumm'd our ſenſes.</p>
               <p>The affections are the nerues, and ſynnewes of the ſpirit: which ſerue to contract, to ſlacken, to lift vp, to lay downe, to ſtirre and ſettle her, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer ſhee will; euen as the body is mooued and remooued, by its liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. VVherefore they ought to be preſerv'd and moderated; not taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way and vtterly deſtroyed. We are to i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitate in this a wel experienced horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; who for to tame and manage well his horſe, will not take from him
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:19962:133"/>
agilitie, and courage; but endeauours eſpecially to bring him to runne, to turne, to riſe, to curuct, to ſtand, how and when it pleaſeth him, and not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the horſes will: Euen ſo when as we perceiue our affections in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining to ſtubborne diſobedience, we muſt correct and reforme them with iudgement &amp; reaſon, and not attempt indiſcreetly wholly to mortifie and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh them.</p>
               <p>We muſt not then diſallow, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue naturall pleaſures, in the like ſort as we doe ſuch as are vicious and ſuperfluous, nor yet condemne the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of them or their fruition. For both in the one and the other, that meane may be obſerv'd, which is commended in all things.</p>
               <p>Yet howſoeuer, we muſt not take ſo much pleaſure and delight, that it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudice the health and ſafety of our ſoules; nor yet ſo little, that our bodies growe feeble and ſickly, through de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect thereof. In ſo doing, whoſoeuer recreateth himſelfe with the moderate
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:19962:133"/>
delectation of an honeſt pleaſure, ſhall be much better reputed, then hee that voluntarilie refuſeth ſo great a good, which freely proſtitutes it ſelfe to his acceptance. For hee neglecteth it, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther through deſpiſall, ſuperſtition, or arroganee: thinking to ſeeme more wiſe in refuſing, then his Creatour was in offering it.</p>
               <p>As for vicious and diſhoneſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, they are to be deteſted, of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie: ſithence ſuch as are ingendred by gourmandizing and ebrietie, doe not onely make men like to beaſts, but a great deale worſe.</p>
               <p>For they neuer eate and drink with ſuch a greedy inſatietie, but that they haue alwayes remembrance and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to retire themſelues into their owne neſts and dennes; whereas man tunnes ſuch diſproportionate meaſure of wine into his belly, that reaſon and iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (for all their ſhifts) are drowned in the deluge: through loſſe of whom, he that (ere whiles) was rationall (but now inſenſible) vnknowes his friends,
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:19962:134"/>
his familiar acquaintance, his ſeruants, nay himſelf. Moreouer; his capacity of wine deſtroyes the capacity of his wit, &amp; makes him abſolutely vnfit for any performances; beſide the wrong it doth vnto his reputation, to the health of his body, and (which is worſt of all) to the ſafety of his ſoule.</p>
               <p>Voluptuous ſenſualitie, and worldly delight, are alwayes inſeparable from a gluttonous belly; which haue the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to tranſforme men into hogges, vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly depriuing them of the loue and knowledge of vertue &amp; honeſty. Such as hunt after them, are induced there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto by an apparant reſemblance of true felicitie promiſed by voluptie: but they find themſelues (incontinently) ſtrangely benumm'd both bodies and ſoules; in ſuch ſort, that the one can deliberate and determine nothing but that which is diſhoneſt: &amp; the other is as impotent in the execution of good: and ſo at laſt it is the vtter ouerthrowe both of their ſenſe and reaſon.</p>
               <p>Volupty is not a iot more gracious
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:19962:134"/>
vnto wealth &amp; riches, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is vnto the ſoul &amp; body: for there is no patrimony or inheritance, ſo infinite in the world, which it wil not deuour in a little time. The greateſt treaſury that euer was ſeen or heard of, was that of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes. For beſide the pillage of gold &amp; ſiluer which they rauaged from all the richeſt cities &amp; kingdoms of the earth, the reuenewes alſo of the Prouinces were yearly brought in to maintain ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences &amp; ſupply their wants: And yet notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, the voluptuous prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality of one Heliogabalus, of one Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modus, of one Caligula, or of one Nero hath clean exhauſted it within 2. years.</p>
               <p>It is not only through want of bread and wine that Venus waxeth cold, but alſo through the penury of gold &amp; ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer. For beſides the heauy expences which are required for the maintena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of volupty; what &amp; how many disburſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments muſt there be, not only for the preparation of curious feaſts and ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quets, but alſo for inueſting our proud ſelues in rich &amp; gay apparel, hoping to
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:19962:135"/>
ſeeme thereby magnificent? Is it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible (vnles men were bereav'd of the vſe of reaſon, nay of common ſenſe) that they ſhould buy at ſo deare a rate, not repentance onely, but pouertie, ſhame, deriſion and diſdaine? what doe I ſay? nay: the indignation of Heauen and the flames of hell.</p>
               <p>It ſeemeth (all things conſidered) not repugnant to reaſon, to attribute vnto ſuch, the titles of forelorne and hopeleſs caſtawayes. For how can they be reputed leſſe, which with ſo ſcorne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full a heele kicke at prudence and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, contemne vertue and honeſtie, neglect their ſoules, deſtroy their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, profuſe their gold, their ſiluer, their ſubſtances, their reuenues, and whatſoeuer elſe is theirs, with ſo prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall, ſo vaine, and ſo needleſſe a lauiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? And laſt of all, vtterlie to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don the country, which firſt nouriſht them?</p>
               <p>Thoſe that ſeeke their beatitude in vicious, wanton, and worldly pleaſures, thinking that they obtaine the ſame
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:19962:135"/>
when they enioy them; are they not exceeding wide from what they aimed at? yea certainely, ſo much the wider, for that their mindes being prepoſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the cunning ſeizure of falſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions, debarre them from hearke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning vnto that, which would willinglie and freelie acquainte them with their tranſgreſsions, redeeme them from that miſery, and euidently declare vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them wherin true and perfect bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude conſiſteth. For indeede we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be croſſed with greater infelicitie, then by eſtabliſhing our happineſs in that, in which alone conſiſts our miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie; and in that alſo we being miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, cannot imagine our ſelues to be ſo, nor credit thoſe that doe perſwade the ſame.</p>
               <p>Proſperitie and welfare is vntimelie wiſht for by any, ſaue only thoſe that are capable thereof, and with an ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt zeale deſire the ſame. Which the vicious and wicked cannot doe; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the way which they perſeuere in, and which ſeemeth vnto them faire,
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:19962:136"/>
pleaſant, and ſpacious, doth lead them to perdition.</p>
               <p>Wherefore hee that vvanteth that which he loueth, cannot be called hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py: Neither can he vvhich hath that which he loueth, if that which he hath be any way offenſiue: Neither may he be accounted happy, which hath that which is ſingularlie good and profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, if he loue not that, which he hath: becauſe thoſe which couet that, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto they cannot attaine, doe alwaies reſt exceedingly tormented. Such as haue that, which they ought not to deſire, are not onelie beguiled, but much abuſed too: and ſuch as deſire not that, which is requiſite to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of their felicitie, are crazie, wey-ward, and diſdainefull: which cannot be by any meanes, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept he to whom it happeneth alwayes remaine a miſerable wretch.</p>
               <p>Therefore we ſay, that all true plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and delectation proceedeth from an action that is perfect. And the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall actions of the ſoule, being much
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:19962:136"/>
more able to attaine vnto a high per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection then the others of the body, which only crawle along vppon the ground; It behooueth man to ſettle his pleaſure and content in them. But theſe alſo cannot be ſaid to be truely perfect (and ſo by conſequence not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectable) except they beare a conſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vniformitie with Reaſon.</p>
               <p>Wherefore it followeth of neceſsity, that the higheſt and heartieſt pleaſure is found in the inioyance of vertue; becauſe ſhee perſwadeth vs to loue and imbrace that which is truely good.</p>
               <p>But there is no good, ſo good as God. He is the beginning, ſource, and fountaine of all goods, that are within the reach of our deſires.</p>
               <p>Wherefore it importeth vs (if wee wiſh for true content and bleſſed hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines) to extend our deſires euen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God himſelfe. He is the ſole and perfect obiect, which our ſoules ought to propoſe vnto themſelues. He is the ende of endes, and the laſt marke which vertue aimeth at. He is the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:19962:137"/>
of all delights: He giueth delecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, without tedious ſatiety, without end.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>He is a paradiſe of ſolide pleaſures.</l>
                  <l>He is a ſunne, whoſe glory ſtill doth ſhine.</l>
                  <l>H' is water, ſprinkling our hearts-ſprouting treaſures.</l>
                  <l>H' is ſuch, whoſe eſſence no one can define.</l>
               </q>
               <p>VVhat is it then, that hindreth vs from being inflamed with the loue of Vertue? ſithence by her ſweete con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, wee gaine the poſſeſsion of ſo great a treaſure. Shee hideth not her ſelfe from our beholdings; but alwaies obiecteth vnto our eye, the radiant luſtre of her beautious face, hoping to entice our dull and ſenſeleſſe hearts, to be enamored with the accompliſht perfection which is reflected on vs, from the golden rayes of her reſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent glory.</p>
               <p>There is no remedy: we muſt needs take heart, and courageouſly ſurpaſſe thoſe encountring difficulties, which ſtand in the very entrance of her Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Nothing that is rare and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, can be atchiev'd without paines
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:19962:137"/>
and induſtrie. For, nature hath anexed difficultie vnto greatnes, to crown the atchieuement with the greater Honor.</p>
               <p>Sithence then there is nothing more excellent then vertue, in whoſe right hand is held the palme of Glory, and in whoſe left a crowne of Honour; Let all our deſignes ſtand on tip-toe to reach vnto her: Let vs ſpare no labours nor paines, no toyles nor trauailes, to gaine the ſocietie of ſo gracious a Guide; ſithence by her, only we mount to heauen. Wee behold her alwayes there permanent, although very few preſent themſelues vnto her, or deſire inioyance of her deereſt ſelfe. The greateſt part of men haue a farre better liking of the faire &amp; ſpacious wayes of vice; preferring her ſilke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> carpet ſtrew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the choiſeſt and moſt fragrant ſorts of flowers, before the rocks and thornes of vertues path: whereby we ſhew, that we are either ignorant in chuſing; or that we chuſe peruerſly what we ought not to chuſe.</p>
               <p>Knowe, man, whatſoeuer thou art,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:19962:138"/>
that vertue can onely ennobliſh thee with honor &amp; glory, to acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pliſh thee with true goodnes &amp; perfect pleaſures, to exalt thee vnto the heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, &amp; to co-vnite thee &amp; thy ſoule with God. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in conſiſteth al mans felicity: and vnto this is referred whatſoeuer is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the <hi>Golden Cabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net of true Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</hi>
